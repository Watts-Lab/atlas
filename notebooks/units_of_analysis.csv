If there is no label, but there is only one or a handful of behaviors, typically these are considered primary.

For this dimension, ignore the constraints of the experiment itself, where researchers needed to measure the behavior by a given date. (Otherwise the answer will be ""yes"" to everything.)

For example: Consider an experiment that nudges healthier eating or workout behaviors. There is no deadline (besides measuring in the experiment) to complete them.

delay,"One of the main ways in which the individual may benefit from doing the behavior are delayed far into the future. 

Here, do NOT consider ways in which the individual benefits that are the same as the ways in which society benefits. 

This feature is trying to capture whether -- from a purely selfish angle only, not as part of a community -- a main benefit of doing the behavior is something the individual will have to wait to experience.

For example: One of the main benefits of saving for retirement is very delayed into the future, for the individual. The same goes for dieting.

vignette,"For the FOCAL BEHAVIOR ONLY: 

Write two to three sentences describing the situational context of the main behavior being nudged. Focus less on what differentiates the conditions and more the generally shared context.

Follow this structure:
Start with 1-3 sentences on the big picture problem, explaining why the target behavior is important in the given context. Then 1 sentence summarizing what organization or person is nudging whom to do what behavior.

For example:
South Africa has one of the highest number of people living with HIV in the world. Circumcision can greatly reduce the risk of HIV transmission. About half of adult males living in South Africa are not circumcised.
