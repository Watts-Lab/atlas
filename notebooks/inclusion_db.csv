With adult asthma uncontrolled in over 60% of U.S. cases, there is a need for scalable, cost-effective tools to improve asthma outcomes. Here we describe a protocol for the Asthma Digital Study, a 24-month, decentralized, pragmatic, open-label, randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of a digital asthma self-management (DASM) program on asthma outcomes in adults. The program leverages consumer-grade devices with a smartphone app to provide â€œsmart nudges,â€ symptom logging, trigger tracking, and other features. Participants are recruited (target Nâ€¯=â€¯900) from throughout the U.S., and randomized to a DASM or control arm (1:1). Co-primary outcomes at one year are a) asthma-associated costs for acute care and b) change from baseline in Asthma Control Testâ„¢ scores.

We tested whether subtly re-designing the restaurant menu, so that plant-based meat alternatives were perceived as the default to a greater extent, increased consumer selection of plant-based meat alternatives. Consumers' freedom of choice was preserved by leaving all choice options on the menu. An online experiment in The Netherlands showed that consumers choose plant-based meat alternatives more often relative to meat when the plant-based option is framed as the default. In a field experiment in a Dutch restaurant, we found that the amount of ordered plant-based meat alternative dishes substantially increased relative to an equivalent meat dish when implementing a default nudge (bean alternative: from 8.6% to 80.0%; seaweed alternative: from 16.1% to 58.3%). Thus, re-designing the menu in a way that suggests that plant-based meat alternatives are the default, while preserving autonomous decision-making, is a promising route to promote out-of-home adoption of plant-based meat alternatives in restaurants.

  Medication adherence is generally low and challenging to address because patient actions control healthcare delivery outside of medical environments. Behavioral nudging changes clinician behavior, but nudging patient decision-making requires further testing. This trial evaluated whether behavioral nudges can increase statin adherence, measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC).
  Methods
  In a 12-month parallel-group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial, adult patients in Intermountain Healthcare cardiology clinics were enrolled. Inclusion required an indication for statins and membership in SelectHealth insurance. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to control or nudges. Nudge content, timing, frequency, and delivery route were personalized by CareCentra using machine learning of subject motivations and abilities from psychographic assessment, demographics, social determinants, and the Intermountain Mortality Risk Score. PDC calculation used SelectHealth claims data.
  Results
  Among 182 subjects, age averaged 63.2¬±8.5 years, 25.8% were female, baseline LDL-C was 82.5¬±32.7 mg/dL, and 93.4% had coronary disease. Characteristics were balanced between nudge (n¬†=¬†89) and control arms (n¬†=¬†93). The statin PDC was greater at 12 months in the nudge group (PDC: 0.742¬±0.318) compared to controls (PDC: 0.639¬±0.358, P¬†=¬†0.042). Adherent subjects (PDC ‚â•80%) were more concentrated in the nudge group (66.3% vs controls: 50.5%, P¬†=¬†0.036) while a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization was non-significant (nudges: 6.7% vs control: 10.8%, P¬†=¬†0.44).
  Conclusions
  Persuasive behavioral nudges driven by artificial intelligence resulted in a clinically important increase in statin adherence in general cardiology patients.

H.;Lim, Yi","This study explores the potential and challenges of applying behavioural interventions to promote micro-mobility adoption. Our online experiments with New York City residents showed that nudges and faming improved respondents‚Äô willingness to adopt e-scooters significantly. Moreover, our experiments spanned over the pre-, during- and post- COVID-19 lockdown period in New York City. Findings from this natural experiment revealed that the effect of these behavioural interventions varied significantly during the pandemic, likely due to a heightened level of health consciousness and a new perspective regarding social interactions. Behavioural tools cannot be taken off-the-shelf and applied as a blanket policy. Individual and group characteristics have to be assessed to devise the pre-eminent behavioural interventions for a particular target audience. More experiments across a wide range of economic, social, cultural, and political settings are needed to guide the application of behavioural interventions in transportation studies.

The importance of cognitive aspects when adopting non-monetary interventions,"Caballero, Nicolas; Ploner, Matteo","Identifying effective behaviour-change interventions to promote energy conservation in the residential sphere has been the topic of extensive empirical research. While existing literature has advised several successful interventions, their context-dependency is still an open question. Furthermore, existing evidence has primarily focused on trialling nudges, that is, interventions that influence behaviour directly by changing aspects of the decision environment and circumventing cognitive bias. Boosts, which instead aim to influence behaviour by fostering the competences of decision-makers and correcting bias, are still under-researched in this domain. We present the results of an online experiment where we compare the effects of a nudge-like, and a boost-like intervention on decisions in an incentive-compatible energy management task. These interventions are trialled in relatively high income and low income populations. Finally, we repeat the experiment with the same participants after removing the interventions. Our results show that income is a significant determinant of performance in the task, with the higher income cohort performing better than the lower income counterpart. However, this difference is largely explained by underlying idiosyncratic factors, namely the level of cognitive competences of participants. Furthermore, both boosting and nudging approaches brought energy savings close to the ceiling of achievable goals, but the boosting approach proved more challenging for participants with lower cognitive competences. Finally, we report evidence of intertemporal spillovers. We conclude by highlighting directions of future research to further assess the interplay between intervention choice and cognitive aspects in the field, to design effective behaviour-change policies in an ethical and targeted manner.",Energy Research & Social Science,2022,10.1016/j.erss.2022.102734,ScienceDirect,8,8,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qn2lzQECcRcgOr-cUlcmnXf7r1Zvh4E1/view?usp=sharing,nicolas.caballero@eurac.edu,Y,,Y,1,1,"Two waves of data collection on the same participant set, where the second wave enables within-subject comparison

Molecular dynamics simulations and the nudged elastic band method were implemented to investigate the atomistic reaction between the two defects and the activation energy required to trigger such an event in various stress or strain states. The results showed that although different GBs were introduced, the most common scenarios were dislocation absorption into the GB and transmission through the GB. In most cases, the leading partial dislocation was absorbed into the GB once these two crystallographic defects impacted. In contrast, the trailing partial dislocation played a crucial role in determination of the threshold reaction stress. From transition state theory, the reaction energy barriers showed a linear relationship with the resolved shear stress or strain state.

A model of signal-based other-pleasing choice,"Bose, Arundhati Sarkar; Sarkar, Sumit","This paper develops a discrete choice model to address the problem of an other-pleasing decision-maker (DM), who makes a choice for another individual without knowing her/his preferences and expectation. The DM's choice may delight or disappoint the other, depending on her/his expectation from the DM. The psychological utility of the other is a function of the emotion triggered by the DM's choice. The objective of the DM is to maximise the expected psychological utility of the other. In the absence of complete information, a risky choice is made by the DM, based on signals about the other's expectation that s/he receives. In terms of personality trait, the DM may be a delight-seeker, or disappointment-averse, or neutral. While a delight-seeker overweighs the other's psychological utility from delight, a disappointment-averse DM overweighs the disutility of disappointment. Based on the model, hypotheses have been constructed and tested in a gamified decision-making scenario that simulated the model conditions. In this serious game experiment, delight-seeking, disappointment-averse, and neutral behaviours were induced by use of appropriate incentivisation of the subjects in the corresponding treatment groups. Unique choice architecture has been given to subjects in each treatment group to signal the expectation of a hypothetical other, and choice decisions were observed under elicited belief.

Whereas the scores are promising to improve food choices from a nutritional point of view, the scant available literature suggests very limited effects on the environmental impact of food choices. Therefore, there remains a need to explore ways to bring about improvements in both areas. As a growing share of consumers buys food groceries online, new opportunities to steer food choices are being created. This article explores the potential of several digital functionalities to further stimulate healthier and pro-environmental food choices amongst consumers. These functionalities included product recommendation agents, product scores, a real-time average impact score of the chosen food basket and a personalised social norm. Those were tested in a two-stage randomized controlled trial with 1000 Belgian household food decision makers in a mock-up E-grocery. Indices reflecting the nutritional quality (NQI) and environmental impact (EII) of the selected food baskets were calculated. The results indicate that at first, displaying a combined Nutri- and Eco-Score at product level led to improved NQI's, but not EII's. However, the scores also led to shifting behaviour in EII's when facilitated with recommendation agents. The display of the average impact scores of the selected basket and of social norms did not lead to additional improvements. Hence, a combined Nutri- and Eco-Score labelling system is recommended, but an enabling environment to consider both scores is important to realise a shift towards more healthy and environmentally friendly food choices. Apart from manifesting healthier and environmentally friendly products with a centralised labelling system, improving their accessibility should be considered at least as important for behavioural changes.",Appetite,2022,10.1016/j.appet.2022.105971,ScienceDirect,16,16,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S6iDuVPtujdhDk2UlJdTz6mRE_xcJ6fo/view?usp=sharing,michiel.debauw@kuleuven.be,Y,,Y,1,1,-,Y,1,Online experiment to test how nutritional and environmental information about food affects food choice in E-grocery context ,Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,Health,Belgium,,Y,8,Y,N,N,"Split between health and environment for domain; 1000 Belgian consumers.

While some consider it acceptable to take smiley selfies in a tragedy zone, others find this behaviour morally questionable. This article demonstrates empirically that excessive time spent on social media explains, at least partially, a greater tendency to like morally ambiguous content on social media. Specifically, this article shows that consumers tend to like more questionable content (such as smiley disaster selfies) on social media when they spend more time online. Further, this article shows that this effect is mediated by increased individualistic thinking. Responses to the survey experiment (N = 206) compared the tendency to like morally ambiguous content between groups of little, moderate and excessive use of social media, and tested for the mediating role of individualistic thinking on the relationship between time spent and liking behaviour. Second, the moderating role of an ethical reminder on time spent and the fact of liking morally ambiguous contents is demonstrated. In the presence of an ethical reminder, the effect of time spent on social media and liking morally ambiguous content becomes insignificant. This article contributes to theory on social media consumption by offering a novel underlying mechanism, such as increased individualistic thinking, as one variable that partly explains the liking for morally ambiguous content. This article also offers practical contributions for social media platforms and policy makers, showing that ethical reminders could be a possible and simple nudge to help consumers act more morally or become aware of morally questionable content.

J.","The increasing diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) can challenge the stability of distribution grids. Smart charging systems can reduce the stress of EV charging on the grid, but the potential of the technology depends on EV drivers' participation in smart charging schemes. To investigate this potential, we conducted an online randomised-controlled experiment with two waves (baseline and experimental phase, N¬†=¬†222), in which we examined drivers' preferences for smart charging and tested a behavioral intervention to increase the number of smart charging choices. We translated state-of-charge (SoC) information from percentage of battery level into miles corresponding to the battery level and tailored information, i.e., the number of driving days covered by the actual SoC based on participants‚Äô personal driving profiles. Participants preferred to use smart charging systems to decrease costs and to increase renewable energy use. However, they tended to overestimate the importance of the battery SoC when setting charging preferences. This overestimation was especially evident for participants who only drive short distances and may be lead to inefficient use of smart charging technology.

One incentive mechanism which has been proposed to achieve such spatial coordination is the agglomeration bonus, a two-part payment scheme which offers a pecuniary (financial) reward for decisions that lead to greater spatial coordination of enrolled land. However, farmers respond to a range of motives when deciding whether to participate in such schemes, including non-pecuniary motives such as a concern for the environment or social comparisons. This study implements a de-contextualised laboratory experiment to test the effectiveness of the agglomeration bonus when non-pecuniary motives are explicitly incorporated into the decision-making environment. We capture intrinsic preferences for the public good dimension of environmental improvement through a real donation to environmental charities and examine the relative impact of a group-ranking nudge.

To address demand for animal-based products, we analyze if the effectiveness of anthropomorphic food labeling as a strategy for promoting plant-based diets is contingent on strong animal ethical beliefs. To this end, we conduct a stated choice experiment with Chilean university students (N = 1538). We manipulate the visual display of the main component of the dish attribute of the choice tasks, using anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic icons to frame the choice of meal options. Our results, which are based on a mixed logit model of the choice data and a linear regression analysis of its individual random parameters, suggest that displaying anthropomorphic icons reduces the likelihood of choosing beef or chicken over vegetables. However, the data provides insufficient evidence to claim an influence on the choice of fish over vegetables. The ethical intuitions that anthropomorphic animals evoke are related to a reduction in the consumption of beef and chicken but do not appear to affect preferences for fish. Our findings support the hypothesis that strong ethical concerns reinforce the effect of anthropomorphic nudges on beef consumption. The results for chicken and fish were inconclusive.

One way of addressing this is a better distribution of market signals to farmers and other market participants, which can help them make better-informed decisions, leading to increased income and capacity for investment. Hence, increasing the availability of market information in Africa is a priority and alternative data sources, and new Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) offer huge potential to complement classic official statistics. This has given rise to a number of ICTs and citizen science projects to monitor data in real time, of which food price crowdsourcing in Africa is one. However, one of the main challenges faced by crowdsourcing initiatives is to ensure that individuals feed useful information into the system. In this paper, we test the potential of behavioural interventions to help sustain crowd contributions by leveraging intrinsic and/or extrinsic motivations. We used two randomised control trials (RCTs) to evaluate whether the inclusion of two nudges (one based on social norms and one based on information disclosure) in the design of a food price crowdsourcing initiative can improve crowd engagement. Our results show that social norms increase crowd participation while disclosing price information does not. The latter highlights the need for further research to identify which type of information and format to make it accessible would best help to sustain crowd effort levels. These findings have the potential to be useful in designing future crowdsourcing (or other types of) initiatives that require sustained citizen engagement over time.",World Development,2022,10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.105818,ScienceDirect,36,32,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/10xgktrxPoO-lobBKgeexCz9oRvAI5MnT/view?usp=sharing,Gloria.SOLANO-HERMOSILLA@ec.europa.eu,Y,,Y,2,2,"Two RCTs: one during w20-w25, another between w28 to w34.

In the field experiment, the shelf placement of the beverage varied exogenously. Displaying less (more) sugary beverages at eye height (the farthest position from eye height) increases (decreases) consumersâ€™ demand by 24.8% (25.3%). The estimated consumersâ€™ degree of inattention to the farthest position from eye height was around 20%.

This study aimed to discover other-regarding information nudges that can reinforce people's intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine without impeding their autonomous decision-making. In March 2021, we conducted an online experiment with 1595 people living throughout Japan, and randomly assigned them either of one control group and three treatment groups that received messages differently describing peer information: control, comparison, influence-gain, and influence-loss. We compared each message's effects on vaccination intention, autonomous decision-making, and emotional response. We found that the influence-gain nudge was effective in increasing the number of older adults who newly decided to receive the vaccine. The comparison and influence-loss nudges further reinforced the intention of older adults who had already planned to receive it. However, the influence-loss nudge, which conveys similar information to the influence-gain nudge but with loss-framing, increased viewers' negative emotion. These messages had no promoting effect for young adults with lower vaccination intentions at baseline. Based on the findings, we propose governments should use different messages depending on their purposes and targets, such as comparison instead of influence-loss, to encourage voluntary vaccination behavior.

The paucity of empirical studies providing â€œproof of implementationâ€ reveals the difficulty of applying previous empirical findings on nudging to mass-eating food services contexts, which serve meals to a lot of individuals daily. Based on the typology of choice architecture in food choice contexts, we closely collaborated with the in-house food service operator to devise and implement five nudge interventions to promote fruits and vegetables (FV) in university cafeterias. Each study was conducted for one 12-week semester or more over a three-year period. In the first two studies, non-verbal point-of-purchase prompting increased the choice of kale/spinach supplemented smoothies and whole fruits from baskets. In Study 3, the combination of sizing and point-of-purchase non-verbal prompting increased the sale of large size vegetable-rich bowls from a stir-fry grill. In Study 4, the proximity type of nudging by altering the position of the healthier option in a sandwich bar in combination with non-verbal prompting increased the sale of sandwiches containing spinach. In Study 5, the combination of sizing and proximity of large vs. small sized plates and serving spoons had no effect on sale of self-serve items in a salad bar. All the interventions except for Study 5 produced a moderate effect in increasing the choice of FV-rich items. We recommend that hospitality and food service operators consider operational parameters and simultaneously adopt more than one nudging components to achieve a sizable effect. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to implement choice architecture techniques in collaboration with food service companies.

Evidence from a rapidly growing literature on moral licensing suggests that interventions targeting behavioral change could lead to an even worse scenario, with individuals starting to underperform in one domain, as a compensation for their good performance in other domains. We propose to study the dynamic of PEBs when individuals are exposed to a specific nudge (priming) via an original experiment designed to capture actual behavior. We found that priming could increase PEB, but does not thwart moral licensing. Primed individuals end up doing worse than non-primed individual under a moral licensing condition.

However, many people remain unwilling to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Objective: Using default nudges, the present study examines (a) whether opt-out policy and its improvements could increase intention and attitude to get vaccinated and (b) whether these default effects differ across diverse risk-perception groups. Method: An online experiment with 1926 unvaccinated Chinese respondents was conducted in February 2021. We measured willingness to be vaccinated after informing opt-in policy, standard opt-out policy, and its five improvements (opt-out education, opt-out opportunity, opt-out social norm, opt-out feedback, and opt-out opportunity). Risk perception of the pandemic of COVID-19 and vaccination were also measured. Results: (a) Opt-out policy and its improvement (except the opt-out transparency) increased intentions to be vaccinated. Policies with a vaccination default did not weaken people's attitude toward policy and policymakers compared with the opt-in policy, but participants in the transparent improvement group reported lower freedom of choice than those in the opt-out group. (b) Further latent profile analysis revealed four classes underlying risk perception: risk exaggerators, risk deniers, disease-specific risk perceivers, and vaccine-specific risk perceivers. But there was no conclusive evidence that the effect of risk perception differs as a function of defaults.

Primary care is a frequent source of pain treatment and opioid prescribing. The objective of the Prescribing Interventions for Chronic Pain using the Electronic health record (PRINCE) study is to assess the effects of two behavioral economics-informed interventions embedded within the electronic health record (EHR) on guideline-concordant pain treatment and opioid prescribing decisions in primary care settings.
Methods
Setting: The setting for this study is 43 primary care clinics in Minnesota. Design: The PRINCE study uses a cluster-randomized 2Â Ã—Â 2 factorial design to test the effects of two interventions. An adaptive design allows for the possibility of secondary randomization to test if interventions can be titrated while maintaining efficacy. Interventions: One intervention alters the â€œchoice architectureâ€ within the EHR to nudge clinicians toward non-opioid treatments for opioid-naÃ¯ve patients and toward tapering for patients currently receiving a â€œhigh riskâ€ opioid. The other intervention integrates the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) directly within the EHR. Outcome: The primary outcome for opioid-naÃ¯ve patients is whether an opioid is prescribed in a primary care visit without a non-opioid alternative pain treatment. The primary outcome for current opioid-using patients is whether opioid prescriptions were tapered with a documented rationale.
Discussion
The PRINCE study will provide real-world evidence on two approaches to improving pain treatment in primary care using the EHR.

We also designed a randomized experiment to test whether and to what extent medical students dropout intention responded to an information nudge that highlighted the prosociality of health professionals in the fight against the virus. Results from a difference-in-differences model and a student fixed effect model suggest that after the onset of COVID-19, the proportion of Chinese undergraduate medical students with a dropout intention declined from 13.7% to 6.8%. Furthermore, the nudge information reduced the intent-to-drop-out probability by 0.8 additional percentage points for students in their early college years.

This study conducted a choice experiment based on a simulated online shop for energetic retrofitting. Here, the resulting financial risk of retrofitting was presented in different treatment groups from these two perspectives. In this vein, participants in the first treatment group were confronted with the resulting risk of deviating energy bill savings (investment risk perspective), which increases with the investment. In the second treatment group, participants were confronted with resulting risk of deviating energy bills after the investment (energy bill risk perspective), which decreases with investment. In the third treatment group, we displayed risk from both perspectives. We found that participants deciding on retrofitting measures within the online shop displaying energy bill risk invested about 20% more than participants in an online shop displaying the investment risk, tested for significance.

The CDC estimates that over 40% of Urgent Care visits are for acute respiratory infections (ARI), more than half involving inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions. Previous randomized trials in primary care clinics resulted in reductions in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, but antibiotic stewardship interventions in telehealth have not been systematically assessed. To better understand how best to decrease inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs in telehealth, we are conducting a large randomized quality improvement trial testing both patient- and physician-facing feedback and behavioral nudges embedded in the electronic health record.
Methods
TeladocÂ® clinicians are assigned to one of 9 arms in a 3Â Ã—Â 3 randomized trial. Each clinician is assigned to one of 3 Commitment groups (Public, Private, Control) and one of 3 Performance Feedback groups (Benchmark Peer Comparison, Trending, Control). After randomly selecting â…“ of states and associated clinicians required for patient-facing components of the Public Commitment intervention, remaining clinicians are randomized to the Control and Private Commitment arms. Clinicians are randomized to the Performance Feedback conditions. The primary outcome is change from baseline in antibiotic prescribing rate for qualifying ARI visits. Secondary outcomes include changes in inappropriate prescribing and revisit rates. Secondary analyses include investigation of heterogeneity of treatment effects. With 1530 clinicians and an intra-clinician correlation in antibiotic prescribing rate of 0.5, we have >80% power to detect 1â€“7% absolute differences in antibiotic prescribing among groups.
Discussion
Findings from this trial may help inform telehealth stewardship strategies, determine whether significant differences exist between Commitment and Feedback interventions, and provide guidance for clinicians and patients to encourage safe and effective antibiotic use.

This exploratory study aimed to examine differential effects of nudging and pricing strategies on food purchases across individuals’ levels of impulsivity, price sensitivity, decision-making styles, and food choice motives. Data from a virtual supermarket experiment where participants were exposed to five study conditions (control, nudging, pricing, salient pricing, and salient pricing with nudging) was used. Participants completed questionnaires assessing their impulsivity, price sensitivity, decision-making styles, and food choice motives. The outcome was the percentage of healthy food purchases. Effect modification was analyzed by adding interaction terms to the statistical models and post- hoc probing was conducted for statistically significant interaction terms. We used data from 400 Dutch adult participants (61.3% female, median age 30.0 years (IQR 24.0)). The effects of the nudging and pricing conditions on healthy food purchases were not modified by impulsivity, price sensitivity, decision-making styles, and the food choice motives ‘health’ and ‘price’.

Overcoming vaccine hesitancy2,3 and failure to follow through on vaccination intentions3 requires effective communication strategies3,4. Here we present two sequential randomized controlled trials to test the effect of behavioural interventions on the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. We designed text-based reminders that make vaccination salient and easy, and delivered them to participants drawn from a healthcare system one day (first randomized controlled trial) (n = 93,354 participants; clinicaltrials number NCT04800965) and eight days (second randomized controlled trial) (n = 67,092 individuals; clinicaltrials number NCT04801524) after they received a notification of vaccine eligibility. The first reminder boosted appointment and vaccination rates within the healthcare system by 6.07 (84%) and 3.57 (26%) percentage points, respectively; the second reminder increased those outcomes by 1.65 and 1.06 percentage points, respectively. The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies (n = 3,181 participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial; this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field. Our findings inform the design of behavioural nudges for promoting health decisions5, and highlight the value of making vaccination easy and inducing feelings of ownership over vaccines.",Nature,2021,10.1038/s41586-021-03843-2,PsychInfo,,67,Y,https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1fzN7Km3WKZ_m1MTwM9rdVCGp20iyEw_L, dcroymans@mednet.ucla.edu,Y,,Y,4,4,-,Y,5,"Online replication experiment from April 2021, testing intent to get vaccinated",Y,Between-subjects only,"Parallel Design (A, B)",Code all,No,Y,"""UCLA Health sent invitations to eligible patients in batches over time to guarantee enough vaccine supply for invited patients.

Workers in six production departments of a textile factory in China were unresponsive to the factory’s rules and monetary incentives to throw waste in trash cans, rather than on the floor. We designed a nudge in the form of decals depicting golden coins placed on the production floors. The coins were intended to counter workers’ motivation to work without pause with their motivation to keep the golden coins uncontaminated by waste, given the shared belief that golden coins are an omen for fortune and luck. Using a stepped wedge repeated within-group design, we randomized which days the coin nudge was implemented, removed, and re-implemented in each department over a period of 5 months. We collected and coded daily pictures (7,927 total) of each production floor before, during, and after these “coin nudge” implementations and removals. Waste on the floor was significantly reduced by over 20% following the first coin nudge imple- mentation, compared to baseline. However, the coin nudge was not effective when reimplemented, after coins were removed without justification. Removing and re-implementing the coin nudge may have shifted workers’ subjective interpretation of the coins. Results support the idea that nudges are not always off-the-shelf, given that they must recognize motivations and subjective interpretations within a particular context.",Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,2021,10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.10.002,PsychInfo,1,71,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d7bOmei-l41qtGgnUb8DJ-Va1xlozPJy/view?usp=share_link, jueyuw@princeton.edu,Y,,Y,12,12,"I think there were two stages across six departments, hence it was 12 BUT it could also be  2 as the departments were  compared to each other.

See notes for step 5: it is going to be very difficult to isolate the between subejcts treatment/control meaures we want for apples to apples comparison in the database, even if we just focus on Phase 1 data from the stepped wedge design. At best, we could compare the beta from the model accounting for time (page 48), comparing the beta of having the coin intervention vs. the pre-coin period. (B=-0.31). But we still need a measure of SD that enables Cohens D, which seems rife to calculate here.

The first implementation comes close, but it's difficult to isolate a clear sample size and result for any ""treatment"" or ""control"" in the way that will allow for apples to apples comparisons of effects:
Stepped wedge design for first implementation: 6 departments received the intervention at staggered time periods -- so Dept 1 who got it first can be compared the other 5 who didn't have it, during the first time period, etc. (Table 1).

Our objective is to investigate the importance of an exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why the COVID-19 outbreak has exploded. To that end, our goal is to document EGPB in the comprehension of disease data, study how it evolves as the epidemic progresses, and connect it with compliance of personal safety guidelines such as the use of face coverings and social distancing. We also investigate whether a behavioral nudge, cost less to implement, can significantly reduce EGPB. 

Rationale: The scientific basis for our inquiry is the received wisdom that infectious disease spread, especially in the initial stages, follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. If people suffer from EGPB, they will likely make incorrect judgments about their infection risk, which in turn, may lead to reduced compliance of safety protocols. 

Method: To collect data on prediction bias, we ran an incentivized, experiment on a global, online platform with participation from people in forty-three countries, each at different stages of progression of COVID-19. We also constructed several indices of compliance by surveying participants about their frequency of hand-washing and use of sanitizers and masks; their willingness to pay for masks; their view about the social appropriateness of others’ behavior; and their like/dislike of government responses. The prediction data was used to construct several measures of EGPB. Our experimental design permits us to identify the root of under-prediction as EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate the speed at which exponential processes unfold. 

Results: Respondents make predictions about the path of the disease using a model that is substantially less convex than the actual data generating process. This creates significant EGPB, which, in turn, is significantly and negatively associated with non-compliance with safety measures. The bias is significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative to those at an early stage of disease progression. A simple behavioral nudge that shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. 

Conclusion: Behavioral biases concerning the comprehension of disease data are quantitatively important, and act as severe impediments to effective policy action against the spread of COVID-19. Clear communication of future infection risk via raw numbers could increase the accuracy of risk perception, in turn, facilitating compliance with suggested protective behaviors.",Social Science & Medicine,2021,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113473,PsychInfo,0,75,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NaVB9tGygegIa7flwhCWC3qwDsRf-L-C/view?usp=share_link,ritwikbanerjee@iimb.ac.in,Y,,Y,2,1,witin subjects randomized; prediction accuracy as outcome,Y,1,"Participants predict COVID-19 related statistics, some are shown data in raw and others in graph form",Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,individuals,individuals,,Health,Multi-Country,"United States of America, France, Germany and Spain",Y,2,N,,N,"Conditions:

One aspect of these campaigns in practice has been the inclusion of injunctive norms messaging, designed to convey a social judgment about one’s behavior (often in the form of encouraging or discouraging language, or a visual smiley or frowny face). While some prominent research has provided support for the use of such messaging as a tool for positive behavior change, causal evidence on the effect of injunctive norms messaging as a motivator (as opposed to just one part of a multifaceted messaging campaign) is limited. This paper presents a field experiment on water conservation behavior conducted by an organization in California, involving over 40,000 households, which provides some of the most precise evidence to date regarding the effect of injunctive norms on decision making. I find that not only do injunctive norms encourage conservation behavior, there is also no evidence that they discourage individuals from further attending to norms messaging–regardless of whether the social judgment conveyed is negative or positive. Taken together, this suggests that injunctive norms are a useful tool in “nudge”-style campaigns tackling behavior change.",Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,2021,10.1016/j.obhdp.2018.11.002,PsychInfo,,84,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qj_xPVtCLXjmJlYcVHHI9lHV45X-KNpN/view?usp=sharing,sbhanot1@swarthmore.edu,Y,,Y,1,1,-,Y,1,Experiment testing the impact of injunctive norms on water conservation behavior ,Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,household,household  *possible double counting see note,,Environment/Energy,United States of America,,Y,4,Y,N,N,"Total N=45,866 homes (each with their own water meter) - see Table 1

Wouter; Duijndam, Sem; Molenaar, AimÃ©e","Losses caused by natural disasters have been increasing worldwide, and climate change is projected to continue this trend in the future. Insurance can be used by individuals to protect against the risk of natural disaster loss. However, individuals often purchase insufficient amounts of insurance against disaster risks, which may be due to them neglecting the likelihood of these risks which are perceived as falling below some threshold level of concern. Using choice architecture, such as alternative forms of risk communication, can nudge individuals to pay attention to natural disasters and increase insurance demand by raising perceived risk and facilitating the comprehension of low probabilities. In an online experiment, we tested whether reframing a low flood probability in terms of the cumulative likelihood across time, as well as whether visualizations of risk on ladders and grids may be effective in raising flood insurance demand. Our primary finding is that reframing of probabilities, especially in combination with the visual aids, generally raises (lowers) demand for flood insurance among younger (older) homeowners and those who are more (less) concerned about the consequences of climate change. Whereas, on average we find no significant impact on flood insurance demand of any of the risk communication tools tested either in isolation or combination.

Designing effective nudges for widespread adoption is important when federal mandates are politically or legally infeasible. We report the results from a survey experiment in which subjects were exposed to one of three video messages from President Trump, and then indicated their preference for wearing a mask. In the first video, the President simply recited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In the second, the President additionally emphasized that wearing a mask is optional. In the third video, the President added that he will not personally wear a mask. We find that exposure to presidential messages can increase the stated likelihood of wearing a maskâ€”particularly among the Presidentâ€™s supporters. We also explore experiential effects of COVID-19, and find that people (especially supporters of the President) are more likely to support wearing a mask if they know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.

Although these services increase investments, they deprive users of the experience of making prudent decisions that would satisfy their need for autonomy. Assuming that freedom of choice facilitates autonomy, we hypothesized that the addition of an element of choice to an automated micro-investment service would increase the amounts invested. To test this idea, we randomised 825 volunteer users of a micro-investments service at an Estonian bank to receive different versions of weekly emails offering a choice to double, quadruple, or keep the money they had accrued for investment through the service. We found that the treatment increased the average investment per participant by 20 to 36%.

Such default nudges are remarkably successful when judged by their effects on the targeted behaviors in isolation. However, there is scant knowledge about possible spillover effects of pro-social behavior that was induced by defaults on subsequent related choices. Behavioral spillover effects could eliminate or even reverse the initially positive effects of choice defaults, and it is thus important to study their significance. We report results from a laboratory experiment exploring the subsequent behavioral consequences of pro-social choice defaults. Our results are promising: Pro-social behavior induced by choice defaults does not result in adverse spillover effects on later, subsequent behavior.

Strategies for an effective intervention after chronic kidney disease (CKD) screening have not been well examined. We describe the rationale and design of a protocol of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of a behavioral intervention using the nudge approach in behavioral economics on CKD patientsâ€™ visiting behaviors to physicians and change in their kidney function after CKD screening.
Methods
The RCT will include CKD patients (Nâ€¯=â€¯4500) detected at screening (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60â€¯mL/min/1.74â€¯m2 or urine protein â‰¥1+), aged 40â€“63 years. The two intervention groups will receive a â€œusual letterâ€ and â€œnudge-based letter,â€ while the control group will only receive a conventional follow-up. Our primary outcome is proportion of patientsâ€™ visiting physicians for 6 months after the intervention; the secondary outcome is change in the eGFR at 2 years after the intervention.
Results
We developed an efficient intervention program after CKD screening and designed the pragmatic RCT to assess its effectiveness in the real world. Our trial is unique in that it investigates the effect of the nudge approach in behavioral economics. By the end of 2018, we have enrolled 1,692 participants, and randomized 677 participants into the usual letter group, 677 participants into the nudge-based letter group, and 338 participants into the control group. We have confirmed that health checkup data could identify a large number of eligible participants.

However, being often very subtle and covert, nudges are also criticized as unethical. By not being transparent about the intention to influence individual choice they might be perceived as limiting freedom of autonomous actions and decisions. So far, empirical research on this issue is scarce. In this study, we investigate whether nudges can be made transparent without limiting their effectiveness. For this purpose we conduct a laboratory experiment where we nudge contributions to carbon emission reduction by introducing a default value. We test how different types of transparency (i.e. knowledge of the potential influence of the default, its purpose, or both) influence the effect of the default. Our findings demonstrate that the default increases contributions, and information on the potential influence, its purpose, or both combined do not significantly influence the default effect. Furthermore, we do not find evidence that psychological reactance interacts with the influence of transparency. Findings support the policy-relevant claim that nudges (in the form of defaults) can be transparent and yet effective.

Indeed, users are frequently given insufficient guidance to enable effective security choices and decisions, which can lead to perceived bad behaviour as a consequence. This paper discusses the forms of support that are possible, and seeks to investigate the effect of doing so in practice. Specifically, it presents findings from two experimental studies that investigate how variations in password meter usage and feedback can positively affect the resulting password choices. The first experiment examines the difference between passwords selected by unguided users and those receiving guidance and alternative forms of feedback (ranging from a traditional password meter through to an emoji-based approach). The findings reveal a 30% drop in weak password choices between unguided and guided usage, with the varying meters then delivering up to 10% further improvement. The second experiment then considers variations in the form of feedback message that users may receive in addition to a meter-based rating. It is shown that by providing richer information (e.g. based upon the time required to crack a password, its relative ranking against other choices, or the probability of it being cracked), users are more motivated towards making strong choices and changing initially weak ones. While the specifics of the experimental findings were focused upon passwords, the discussion also considers the benefits that may be gained by applying the same principles of nudging and guidance to other areas of security in which users are often found to have weak behaviours.",Computers & Security,2018,10.1016/j.cose.2018.01.016,ScienceDirect,,204,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O4oX755NMzIzBHJ7ZqKTdQsAmAn5qMUb/view?usp=sharing,steven.furnell@plymouth.ac.uk,Y,,Y,2,2,-,Y,2,Experiment to see whether different password nudges will cause increased security in passwords - not primary! reporting from another primary source,Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,individuals,individuals,,Privacy/Security/Crime,United States of America,,Y,4,Y,N,N,"Conditions:

The results indicate a statistically significant increase in food waste recycled compared to a control group in the research area. The data analysed was on the weight of food waste collected from sorting stations in the research area, and the collection period stretched for almost 2 years, allowing us to study the short- and long term effects of the intervention. Although the immediate positive effect of the leaflet seems to have attenuated over time, results show that there was a significant difference between the control and the treatment group, even 8 months after the leaflet was distributed. Insights from this study can be used to guide development of similar pro-environmental behaviour interventions for other urban areas in Sweden and abroad, improving chances of reaching environmental policy goals.

However, evidence indicates that such programs are more effective at influencing food knowledge and preferences than actual food choices. Such finding may occur because school gardens insufficiently influence the food behavior of parents and because healthy food items are not always available in children's homes. We tested this hypothesis using a one-year cluster randomized controlled trial in Nepal with 15 treatment and 15 control schools and a matched sample of 779 schoolchildren (aged 8â€“12) and their caregivers. Data were collected before and after the intervention during the 2018â€“2019 school year. In addition, children's food consumption was monitored using a monthly food logbook. Average treatment effects were quantified with a double-difference estimator.

We tested whether subtly re-designing the restaurant menu, so that plant-based meat alternatives were perceived as the default to a greater extent, increased consumer selection of plant-based meat alternatives. Consumers' freedom of choice was preserved by leaving all choice options on the menu. An online experiment in The Netherlands showed that consumers choose plant-based meat alternatives more often relative to meat when the plant-based option is framed as the default. In a field experiment in a Dutch restaurant, we found that the amount of ordered plant-based meat alternative dishes substantially increased relative to an equivalent meat dish when implementing a default nudge (bean alternative: from 8.6% to 80.0%; seaweed alternative: from 16.1% to 58.3%).

Results show that carbon footprint labels led to a decrease in the probability of selecting a high-carbon footprint meal by approximately 2.7 percentage points with consumers substituting to mid-carbon impact meals. We find no change in the market share of low-carbon meals, on average. The reduction in high-carbon footprint meals is driven by decreases in sales of meat meals while sales of mid-ranged vegan, vegetarian and fish meals all increased. We estimate that the introduction of carbon footprint labels was associated with a 4.3% reduction in average carbon emissions per meal.

Although the results show the potential of nudges, it is unknown whether short messages can change motivations in the population that did not get vaccinated immediately.

Objective  To test an automated behavioral intervention to prevent weight gain and improve diet using employee cafeteria purchasing data.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This individual-level randomized clinical trial of a 12-month intervention with 12 months of follow-up was conducted among employees of a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who purchased food at on-site cafeterias that used traffic-light labels (ie, green indicates healthy; yellow, less healthy; red, unhealthy). Participants were enrolled September 2016 to February 2018. Data were analyzed from May to September 2020.

Interventions  For 12 months, participants in the intervention group received 2 emails per week with feedback on previous cafeteria purchases and personalized health and lifestyle tips and 1 letter per month with peer comparisons and financial incentives for healthier purchases. Emails and letters were automatically generated using survey, health, and cafeteria data. Control group participants received 1 letter per month with general healthy lifestyle information.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The main outcome was change in weight from baseline to 12 months and 24 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included changes in cafeteria purchases, including proportion of green- and red-labeled purchases and calories purchased per day, from baseline (12 months preintervention) to the intervention (months 1-12) and follow-up (months 13-24) periods. Baseline Healthy Eating Index-15 (HEI-15) scores were compared to HEI-15 scores at 6, 12, and 24 months.

Results  Among 602 employees enrolled (mean [SD] age, 43.6 [12.2] years; 478 [79.4%] women), 299 were randomized to the intervention group and 303 were randomized to the control group. Baseline mean (SD) body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was 28.3 (6.6) and HEI-15 score was 60.4 (12.4). There were no between-group differences in weight change at 12 (0.2 [95% CI, −0.6 to 1.0] kg) or 24 (0.6 [95% CI, −0.3 to 1.4] kg) months. Compared with baseline, the intervention group increased green-labeled purchases by 7.3% (95% CI, 5.4% to 9.3%) and decreased red-labeled purchases by 3.9% (95% CI, −5.0% to −2.7%) and calories purchased per day by 49.5 (95% CI, −75.2 to −23.9) kcal more than the control group during the intervention period. In the intervention group, differences in changes in green (4.8% [95% CI, 2.9% to 6.8%]) and red purchases (−3.1% [95% CI, −4.3% to −2.0%]) were sustained at the 24-month follow-up. Differences in changes in HEI-15 scores were not significantly different in the intervention compared with the control group at 6 (2.2 [95% CI, 0 to 4.4]), 12 (1.8 [95% CI, −0.6 to 4.1]), and 24 (1.6, 95% CI, −0.7 to 3.8]) months.

Field experimental evidence from Brazil,"SchÃ¤chtele, Simeon; Eguino, HuÃ¡scar; Roman, Soraya","Deficient taxpayer information is a major impediment for taxation, particularly in developing countries. However, in contrast to the well-established literature on nudging tax compliance, field experimental evidence on low-cost interventions to improve the taxpayer registry is scarce. This paper presents the first evidence on promoting registration in an online tax registry. We randomized outreach communications to over 160Â K Brazilian property taxpayers, thereby targeting a tax considered a sleeping giant in Latin America. A simple request to join the registry, embedded in a graphically designed e-mail, substantially increased registration relative to a control treatment. Strikingly, however, adding a lottery reward unintendedly reduced registration in comparison to the simple request. Survey evidence, unavailable in previous studies, points to altered effective motivations to register as an explanation. We highlight one mechanism that can reconcile different results in the literature: rewards may signal voluntariness and lack of enforcement. This is also consistent with the results of our analysis of property tax payments. It suggests that the e-mails increased tax payments of certain taxpayers, but that the lottery treatment lowered payment rates for high-value properties. In sum, nudging may be one element of a successful strategy to improve taxpayer registration.

One way of addressing this is a better distribution of market signals to farmers and other market participants, which can help them make better-informed decisions, leading to increased income and capacity for investment. Hence, increasing the availability of market information in Africa is a priority and alternative data sources, and new Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) offer huge potential to complement classic official statistics. This has given rise to a number of ICTs and citizen science projects to monitor data in real time, of which food price crowdsourcing in Africa is one. However, one of the main challenges faced by crowdsourcing initiatives is to ensure that individuals feed useful information into the system. In this paper, we test the potential of behavioural interventions to help sustain crowd contributions by leveraging intrinsic and/or extrinsic motivations. We used two randomised control trials (RCTs) to evaluate whether the inclusion of two nudges (one based on social norms and one based on information disclosure) in the design of a food price crowdsourcing initiative can improve crowd engagement. Our results show that social norms increase crowd participation while disclosing price information does not. The latter highlights the need for further research to identify which type of information and format to make it accessible would best help to sustain crowd effort levels. These findings have the potential to be useful in designing future crowdsourcing (or other types of) initiatives that require sustained citizen engagement over time.",World Development,2022,10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.105818,ScienceDirect,36,32,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/10xgktrxPoO-lobBKgeexCz9oRvAI5MnT/view?usp=sharing,Gloria.SOLANO-HERMOSILLA@ec.europa.eu,Y,,Y,2,2,"Two RCTs: one during w20-w25, another between w28 to w34.

Why do individuals engage in intergroup conflict as often as they do? We propose that groupsâ€™ tendencies to present intergroup conflict as the default option and individualsâ€™ tendencies to disproportionately choose default options fuel individual participation in intergroup conflict. Three experiments (total N = 893) that used incentivized economic games found support for this hypothesis. Designating intergroup conflict as the default option significantly increased individual participation in conflict relative to a no-default condition and to designating other behavioral options as defaults. The effects of defaults on intergroup conflict generalized across different social identities and levels of group identification. Our findings explain the stickiness of conflict and identify choice architecture as a potential solution: changing existing defaults can redirect intergroup behavior. We discuss promising directions for future research on the psychological mechanisms underlying these effects.

We examine the effectiveness of a welcome letter from the tax authority that aims to nudge first-time taxpayers to lodge their first income tax return. We compare this letter to a standard letter that emphasizes the possibility of penalties and interest charges. We find that both letters have surprisingly similar effects on tax compliance, suggesting that the main channel through which the letters affect individual behavior is by providing information.

Efforts to reduce this runoff have focused on industrial and agricultural sources, while little attention has been paid to encouraging residents to reduce runoff from their properties. To study residents’ willing- ness to adopt landscaping practices that reduce runoff, we conducted a field experiment in the Delaware River watershed. In the experiment, over three hundred adults participated in a series of random-price auctions that revealed their willingness to pay (WTP) for five products that reduce nutrient runoff. To study how WTP can be influenced by attributes of the choice architecture, we randomized the starting bid values (anchors) and the way in which the external benefits of the five practices were framed. Compared to a neutral framing, a positive framing (using the product can improve water quality) increased aver- age WTP by about one-third, while the estimated effect of a negative framing (failing to use the product can worsen water quality) was also positive, but smaller and not statisti- cally different from zero. The estimated effect on average WTP from the anchor depends on how bids of $0 are modeled, but the results imply that higher anchors lead to higher WTP.

We present a large field experiment ( N = 47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were 1) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and 2) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctorâ€™s appointment and indicated it was reserved for them.

Dogs walked off leash or left outside frequently kill fragile kiwi, posing a major social issue. Local governments have spread awareness through billboards, pamphlets, and other media, but there are no empirical analyses of message effectiveness or targeting. There is a dearth of research on behavioural interventions in conservation, where pro-environmental behaviour is typically costly to individuals. This study uses a randomised control trial (RCT) to test the effectiveness of four different messages on a local policy for dog registration, using thousands of households. The RCT aims to increase dog registration fees, which, although compulsory, have low compliance in some areas. Results suggest considerable heterogeneity in response across messages, with only messages focussed on kiwi conservation and dog attacks having an impact on registration, and only in some groups. A social norm /â€nudgeâ€-based message had no effect. Results should help design future messaging programs, as well as raise funds for conservation through additional registration fees.

The recent proliferation of web-based food ordering systems provides a unique opportunity to support healthy purchasing from schools. Embedding evidence-based choice architecture strategies within these routinely used systems provides the opportunity to impact the purchasing decisions of many users simultaneously and warrants investigation. Objective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a multistrategy behavioral intervention implemented via a web-based school canteen lunch ordering system in reducing the energy, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium content of primary studentsâ€™ web-based lunch orders. Methods: The study used a parallel-group, cohort, cluster randomized controlled trial design with 2207 students from 17 Australian primary schools. Schools with a web-based canteen lunch ordering system were randomly assigned to receive either a multistrategy behavioral intervention that included choice architecture strategies embedded in the web-based system ( n = 9 schools) or the standard web-based ordering system only (n = 8 control schools). Automatically collected student purchasing data at baseline (term 2, 2018) and 12 months later (term 2, 2019) were used to assess trial outcomes. Primary trial outcomes included the mean energy (kJ), saturated fat (g), sugar (g), and sodium (mg) content of student lunch orders. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of all web-based lunch order items classified as everyday, occasional , and caution (based on the New South Wales Healthy School Canteen Strategy) and canteen revenue. Results: From baseline to follow-up, the intervention lunch orders had significantly lower energy content (âˆ’69.4 kJ, 95% CI âˆ’119.6 to âˆ’19.1; P = .01) and saturated fat content (âˆ’0.6 g, 95% CI âˆ’0.9 to âˆ’0.4; P &lt; .001) than the control lunch orders, but they did not have significantly lower sugar or sodium content. There was also a small significant between-group difference in the percentage of energy from saturated fat (âˆ’0.9%, 95% CI âˆ’1.4% to âˆ’0.5%; P &lt; .001) but not in the percentage of energy from sugar (+1.1%, 95% CI 0.2% to 1.9%; p = .02). Relative to control schools, intervention schools had significantly greater odds of having everyday items purchased (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0; P &lt; .001), corresponding to a 9.8% increase in everyday items, and lower odds of having occasional items purchased (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8; P &lt; .001), corresponding to a 7.7% decrease in occasional items); however, there was no change in the odds of having caution (least healthy) items purchased (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-1.0; P = .05). Furthermore, there was no change in schoolsâ€™ revenue between groups. Conclusions: Given the evidence of small statistically significant improvements in the energy and saturated fat content, acceptability, and wide reach, this intervention has the potential to influence dietary choices at a population level, and further research is warranted to determine its impact when implemented at scale.

However, studies on the impact of eye cues on prosocial behavior in economic games yield ambiguous findings and thus provide no clear answer to the question whether these nudges have the potential to cause significant behavioral change. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of watchful eyes remain unclear. We investigate whether cues of being watched positively affect prosocial behavior in the dictator game when a recipient is physically present. In a post-experimental questionnaire, we gathered additional information on attitudes towards trust and voluntary cooperation and on emotional responses to eye images. The weak effect observed in our study suggests that images of human eyes may increase cooperative behavior in the dictator game, providing support for the idea that the ‘watchful eyes effect’ is caused by a concern for avoiding bad reputation. Individual differences in attitudes towards trust and voluntary cooperation did not account for this effect. Furthermore, data from our post-experimental questionnaire provided mixed support for the theory that the watchful eyes effect may ultimately stem from higher levels of negative emotions related to the feeling of being watched caused by the exposure to human eye images. While we found no difference in the positive or negative affect schedule (PANAS) related to eye images and flowers after a long exposure during the experiment, participants in the control group associated lower levels of pleasure and a more dominant feeling (SAM) with the eye images after a short exposure to both stimuli.

To increase vaccination rates, governments across the world are considering the use of monetary incentives. Here we present evidence about the effect of guaranteed payments on COVID-19 vaccination uptake. We ran a large preregistered randomized controlled trial (with 8286 participants) in Sweden and linked the data to population-wide administrative vaccination records. We found that modest monetary payments of 24 US dollars (200 Swedish kronor) increased vaccination rates by 4.2 percentage points ( P = 0.005), from a baseline rate of 71.6%. By contrast, behavioral nudges increased stated intentions to become vaccinated but had only small and not statistically significant impacts on vaccination rates. The results highlight the potential of modest monetary incentives to raise vaccination rates.

Background
Hospital-care-associated infections (HCAIs) represent the most frequent adverse event during care delivery, affecting hundreds of millions of patients around the world. Implementing and ensuring conformity to standard precautions, particularly best hand hygiene practices, is regarded as one of the most important and cheapest strategies for preventing HCAIs. However, despite consistent efforts at increasing conformity to standard hand hygiene practices at hospitals, research has repeatedly documented low conformity levels amongst staff, patients and visitors alike.
Aim
The behavioural sciences have documented the potential of adjusting seemingly irrelevant contextual features in order to â€˜nudgeâ€™ people to conform to desirable behaviours such as hand hygiene compliance (HHC). In this field experiment we investigate the effect on HHC amongst visitors upon entry of a hospital by varying such features.
Methods
Over 50 days, we observed the HHC of a total of 46,435 hospital visitors upon their entry to the hospital in a field experimental design covering eight variations over the salience, placement and assertion of the hand sanitizer in the foyer, including the presence of the yearly national HHC campaign and a follow up during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Findings
Our experiment found that varying seemingly irrelevant features increased HHC from a baseline of 0.4%â€“19.7% (47.6% during COVID-19). The experiment also found that the national HHC-campaign had no direct statistically significant effect on HHC.
Conclusion
Varying seemingly irrelevant contextual features provides an effective, generic, cheap and easy to scale approach to increasing HHC relative to sanitizing one's hands at hospitals.",Journal of Hospital Infection,2021,10.1016/j.jhin.2021.09.009,ScienceDirect,,95,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nttd4yjDQznOTd35kWVPCMyrJmVWurGk/view?usp=sharing,pgh@ruc.dk,Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,Assessing interventions to improve hand hygiene from employees and guests at a hospital,Y,Between-subjects only,Pre-post style without clear randomization,Case-by-case,"Yes, more than one period per condition AND individuals likely only experience one - OK TO CODE",Y,Rolled out sequentially not really in parallel.

In order to prevent the spread of the virus, one of the most important measures is practicing hand hygiene. We see nudging, a technique from behavioural economics, as a possible way to increase hand hygiene without relying on mandatory measures. In this field experiment, we test two nudge types that previously have been applied successfully, a salience nudge and a gain frame nudge, in a new context (i.e., shopping street). Four hundred nineteen shoppers were observed during a counterbalanced experiment in three stores, where a disinfectant dispenser was accompanied by a salience nudge, gain frame nudge, or no nudge. Data on dispenser usage was analysed using mixed models to account for groups entering the store. When compared to the control condition, no significant effect of either nudge on participants using the disinfectant was found. This could be caused by the increased attention for hand hygiene during COVID-19, because the baseline for practicing hand hygiene in our study was much higher than that in previous pre-COVID-19 studies. Alternatively, it is possible that shoppers already disinfected their hands before leaving the house, as advised by the government. Our results suggest that stores, and governments, should look for other measures than the tested nudges to improve hand hygiene in the shopping street during the COVID-19 pandemic, either combining different nudges and/or using less subtle methods.

We present findings from a large-scale field experiment designed to encourage LMI tax filers to save their tax refund. The experiment tested combinations of behavioral strategies to promote savings including (1) asking filers at the start of tax preparation to pre-commit to saving their refund, and (2) choice architecture manipulations that emphasized directly depositing their refund into savings accounts or savings bond purchases. The four intervention conditions had a positive impact on the rate of refund deposits into savings accounts, increasing the deposit rate between 42% and 64%. However, the intervention conditions had minimal effects on the rate of bond purchases. The primary driver of increased savings deposits was the manipulation of the choice architecture. By comparison, savings pre-commitments had a more modest effect on savings deposits, on average. The impact of a pre-commitment on savings deposits varies over the course of the tax season, however, with early tax filers being much more responsive to pre-commitment than were later tax filers.

Past research suggests that even when the final outcome is identical, observers perceive stronger signals from choices that switch from, rather than stay with, the default. In five experiments using hypothetical scenarios and an incentivized economic game, we test whether decision-makers driven by image concerns could strategically exploit that asymmetric signal. We found that in the presence of observers, participants were more likely to self-select into defaults that require them to switch to enhance a positive signal and into defaults that require them to stay to attenuate a negative signal.

Furthermore, the implementation rates had increased for some of the energy-efficiency behaviors that were mentioned in the advice. Additionally, the opening ratios of the push notifications were improved 1.2 and 1.3 times using personalized sentences and adjusting the timing of the push notifications, respectively. These results indicated that personalization of the push notifications could increase the number of users who check the advice. An increase in the energy efficiency rate was observed among households who checked the advice on the standby screen of the smartphone and the dialog and notification list screen in the app. Although this study used relatively simple logic to deliver personalized energy efficiency advice, the results suggest that utilizing smartphones and various data, as well as making communication more interactive between the users and service providers, could effectively induce energy-efficient behavior.",Energy and Buildings,2020,10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110151,ScienceDirect,,125,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/16MUml943jzZJQqUr3yYK819JqanimcIX/view?usp=sharing,hyunbae.kim27@gmail.com,Y,,Y,5,1,"Authors say it's an RCT with ""2 sub-RCTs"" but this is really one data collection period, with multiple arms",Y,1,impact of push notifications about energy efficiency on electricity consumption,Y,Between-subjects only,"Parallel Design (A, B)",Code all,No,Y,,Y,ITT or Encouragement Design,No,Simple,Individuals,N,household,household,,Environment/Energy,Japan,,Y,2,Y,N,N,"At the highest level --> use this

Our results support the suggestion that socially motivated appeals are significantly more emotionally taxing than monetary incentives.

Low-cost message-based interventions are increasingly used to promote target behaviours. While growing evidence shows that such â€˜nudgesâ€™ often significantly impact behaviour, understanding of why interventions work or fail in particular contexts remains underdeveloped. In a natural field experiment conducted before the 2015 UK general election, we varied messages on a postcard sent by Oxford City Council to unregistered students encouraging them to join the electoral register. Our primary finding from the field study is that just one of our interventionsâ€”a reminder that people failing to register may be finedâ€”has a significant positive impact. Offering small monetary rewards to register instead has a negative but insignificant effect. In a second study, using an online experiment we identify a particular mechanism explaining the influence of this intervention. Specifically, we show that our interventions have divergent effects on perceptions of the normative appropriateness of registering: emphasising that failing to register is punishable by law strengthened the perception that one ought to register, while offering monetary inducements for registering weakened the perception that doing so is an action already expected within society.

Across four treatments, participants received one random truthful norm-nudge that emphasized â€˜moral suasion based on either what other participants previously did (empirical message) or approved of doing (normative message) and varied in the framing (positive or negative) in which it was presented. Subsequently, participants repeatedly played the â€˜mind gameâ€™ in which they were first asked to think of a number, then rolled a digital die, and then reported whether the two numbers coincide, in which case a bonus was paid. Hence, whether or not the report was truthful remained unobservable to the experimenters. We find compelling null effects with tight confidence intervals showing that none of the norm-nudge interventions worked. A follow-up experiment reveals the reason for these convincing null-effects: the information norm-nudges did not actually change norms. Notably, our secondary results suggest that a substantial portion of individuals misremembered norm-nudges such that they conveniently supported deviant behavior. This subset of participants indeed displayed significantly higher deviance levels, a behavior pattern in line with literature on motivated misremembering and belief distortion. We discuss the importance of this high-powered null finding for the flourishing norm-nudge literature and derive policy implications.

We sent different versions of a recruitment/enrollment letter to agricultural producers in 36 Nebraska counties with historically very low levels of CSP enrollment. We found that the letters doubled the uptake rates as compared to the control (no letter) population. Personalized letters with a handwritten phrase appealing to people's empathetic tendencies toward environmental conservation â€“ an empathy nudge â€“ had the largest impact. When the same nudge was photocopied, it performed statistically significantly worse than handwritten and somewhat (statistically insignificant) worse than a standard letter. The experimental results suggest that the USDA can double the application rate at a cost of only $58â€“116 per farm. If the money spent on sending letters were instead directed toward increasing financial incentives, it would be cost-equivalent to adding 2.5â€“5 cents per acre per year to CSP payments. During the time of the experiment, the CSP payments in the state were on average $6.8/acre for rangeland and $24/acre for cropland per year, and extra 2.5â€“5 cents per acre per year is unlikely to affect the decision of a farmer to apply. As such, from an agri-environmental policy perspective, using personalized letters is highly cost effective.",Ecological Economics,2019,,ScienceDirect,,167,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5f_xgLQUA0JnBVJtDe4FGT2qspk9WEV/view?usp=sharing,nczap@umich.edu,Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,"field experiment encouraging farmers application for agri-environmental schemes, using nudges",Y,Between-subjects only,"Parallel Design (A, B)",Code all,No,Y,,Y,ITT or Encouragement Design,No,Simple,Individuals,N,farmers,farmers,,Environment/Energy,United States of America,,Y,4,Y,N,N,"Conditions:

In particular, home energy reports (HERs) have been used to induce behavioural change among residential consumers. These HERs typically provide peer comparisons of energy use and information about energy savings opportunities. Despite the growing prevalence of HERs and a shift from postal to electronic delivery of HERs, the experimental evidence base of their effectiveness comes primarily from HERs delivered by post from a single vendor (Opower). Whether that evidence generalises to other programmes and to the electronic delivery of HERs is unclear. This paper reports new evidence for HER effectiveness from a 12-month field experiment with approximately 9,000 households that tested electronic HER programme in a deregulated American residential electricity market. Despite high non-compliance with HER delivery, the programme reduced household electricity consumption by 2.9%, 95% CI [-5.0%, âˆ’0.76%]. This estimated reduction is consistent with prior estimated impacts of HERs delivered by post and implies electronic HERs are at least as effective as reports delivered by post in reducing electricity consumption, while they are administered at a lower cost.",Energy Policy,2019,10.1016/j.enpol.2019.06.039,ScienceDirect,0,188,Yes,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMonc3z4dP5Wz02n3Q6z9ng98v1A3Avv/view?usp=sharing,ak219@cam.ac.uk,Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,Experiment evaluating the efficacy of electronic home energy reports,Y,Between-subjects only,"Parallel Design (A, B)",Code all,No,Y,,Y,ITT or Encouragement Design,No,Simple,Individuals,N,households,households,,Environment/Energy,United States of America,,Y,2,Y,N,Y,"Conditions:

How nudge source renders dynamic norms (in-)effective in eliciting sustainable behavior,"Boenke, Lisa; Panning, Miriam; Thurow, Anika; HÃ¶risch, Jacob; Loschelder, David D.","Although communicating so-called ‘dynamic norms’ may promote sustainable consumption behavior, the pre- sent study challenges the assumption that their impact is inevitably positive. On the contrary, it seeks to expand current research by establishing when and why sources with vested motives may result in a backfiring effect of dynamic norms. Our experiment (N=352) investigates consumers’ intentions to reduce their meat consumption after reading norm messages from different sources (i.e., a researcher, vegan activist, company representative). In line with the predictions, dynamic norm messages from a researcher led to more sustainable consumption choices than identical messages communicated by a vegan activist or company representative while controlling for gender. Concerning the underlying theoretical mechanisms, a perceived moral superiority and ensuing psychological reactance sequentially explained the backfiring effect for the vegan activist. The backfiring effect for the company representative was mediated by a perceived pro-self-motivation that again resulted in elevated consumer reactance. Overall, the present findings establish the crucial importance of a nudge’s source that either fosters or undermines the effectiveness of a dynamic norm message in eliciting sustainable behavior. The results not only contribute to the academic debate on nudging, but can also inform practitioners to choose the most powerful sender (e.g. academics) when designing sustainable norm interventions.",Journal of Cleaner Production,2022,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133246,ScienceDirect,,57,Y,https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1fzN7Km3WKZ_m1MTwM9rdVCGp20iyEw_L,"hoerisch@leuphana.de

While making these mindless decisions, peo- ple often rely on heuristics. In this paper, we demonstrate that these heuristics can be exploited to nudge consumers towards healthy alternatives. Specifically, we explore how the attraction effect (i.e., adding a decoy to a choice set) can nudge people to choose a healthy snack. The results of our choice experiment indicate that adding a decoy (i.e., a less attractive food alternative) to a self-control situation (i.e., choosing between a healthy and an unhealthy food alternative) can help people maintain self-control and choose the healthy option. This mixed choice set thus nudges people towards the healthy option. Moreover, our results show differential effects of the attraction effect depending on the (un)healthiness of the products in the choice set. Specifically, the attraction effect is prominent when the choice set consists of unhealthy products only (i.e., the unhealthy choice set), but not in the choice set that consists of only healthy products (i.e., healthy choice set).

To test the responsiveness of wine consumers to carbon footprint stimuli we set a natural field experiment in a restaurant modifying the choice architecture of wine decisions. We modified wine cards to provide different information and price incentives to consumers to test the effects of two policy interventions for reducing CO2 emissions. Specifically, we test the provision of carbon footprint information and an additional price for carbon emissions. We randomly assigned subjects to four different wine cards. Results show that carbon footprint information alone is not enough to affect wine choices, but its effect becomes significant when combined with a price change. A card showing the carbon footprint of wine bottles and proportionally higher wine prices was associated with choices leading to lower carbon emissions. However, when information about the additional price to offset wine carbon emissions was made explicitly visible to consumers on another card, an opposite effect of an increase in the choice of wines with higher carbon-emitting production processes was observed.

Here, we consider a different possibilityâ€”that anomalies, particularly those related to cognitive processing, may be a valuable source of diagnostic information. More specifically, we hypothesize that the extent to which the prechoice information search has been atypical (anomalous) can be used to reverse-infer important latent features of the decision process. For instance, based on atypicalities in how juries examine courtroom evidence, can we infer if they were biased by media reports; or if financial traders browsed public stock market data in a way sufficiently unusual to indicate access to insider information? In our preregistered experiment, participants viewed expert opinions about financial stocks, before deciding whether to invest and get paid according to the subsequent market return, adjusted by an independent random amount. We used eye-tracking and machine-learning dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection techniques to measure the extent to which eye-movements while viewing opinions were idiosyncratic/anomalous. We found that nudging participants by disclosing the return adjustment value beforehand (thus giving them â€œprivileged informationâ€) made their patterns of subsequently viewing opinions more idiosyncratic. With those idiosyncrasies as potential markers of top-down attentional control, we demonstrated a reverse-inference of motivation and prior knowledge from attention, predicting if people were nudged in a particular direction based on how idiosyncratically they then searched for information.

Three experiments, including a field experiment and a pre-registered experiment, incorporate three types of personal attributes (physical appearance, nationality, and gender) and find both a free-riding effect for the disadvantaged person and a cost-bearing effect for the advantaged person. Specifically, the disadvantaged person receives better treatment by following the advantaged person, and the advantaged person receives worse treatment by following the disadvantaged person. These effects occur only if the attribute that differentiates the disadvantaged and advantaged persons is perceived as unjustifiable, and they disappear if the attribute is perceived as justifiable, suggesting that these effects are due not to anchoring, but to the actor’s need for justifiability.

The Role of Social Comparison and Implicit Self-Theories,"Hogreve, Jens; Matta, Shashi; Hettich, Alexander S.; Reczek, Rebecca Walker","Despite the proliferation of healthier side items for children at fast food restaurants, many parents still do not make healthy choices for their children in this setting. The goal of this research is to identify the parents most likely to do so and develop an intervention to nudge these parents toward making healthier choices in retail outlets. Across four field studies conducted in a retail environment (i.e., locations of a fast food restaurant chain), the authors predict and find that parents with a high tendency to engage in social comparison and a malleable view of the self are most likely to conform to the norm in their parental social network. Given that the norm in the population studied is to order a less healthy side item (e.g., fries) versus a healthy side item (e.g., fruit), conforming results in significantly less healthy orders for the children of these individuals. The authors demonstrate that a social norm-based intervention designed to set a new healthy norm in this retail environment succeeded in increasing the overall proportion of parents that chose a healthy side item by over 29% by increasing the choice of healthy sides specifically for these individuals.

Center workshop registration and invitation recall and acceptability were compared between the 2 arms.
Results: No statistically significant differences in workshop registration (25% vs 20%; P = 0.61), invitation recall (69% vs 62%; P = 0.58) or acceptability (mean: 8.38 vs 8.06; P = 0.50) were found between interven- tion and control centers, respectively.

In four experiments, we make different social or personal norms salient by aligning choice environments with psychosocial mechanisms that activate different types of norms. We use different choice architecture techniques to change information, alter product sets, and generate the social consequences of choices. The target behavior, purchasing a recycled paper notebook, is captured through direct purchase behaviors or willingness to pay commitments. We find that choice architecture activates personal but not social norms, and that associated positive and negative emotions (guilt, shame, regret and pride) are elicited by choices but not by willingness to pay.

Thirty-six subjects participated in an experiment conducted in an environmental room controlled to maintain a stable warm condition (operative temperature: 29.5Â Â°C; corresponding PMV: 1.44). Each subject had full control over a small, individual desk fan, and feedback messaging (the â€˜nudgeâ€™) was delivered via laptop computers. Real-time usage status of desk fans was monitored, and subjects completed questionnaires before and after their test session, in addition to within-session subjective thermal evaluations. For the sample tested, feedback messaging was observed to nudge occupants to reduce usage of the device (desk fan) in the warm environment and to tolerate accompanying thermal discomfort, though preference to be cooler increased for some. Whilst this finding may eventually lead to future application for supporting changes to HVAC system operation and setpoints that align with adaptive comfort ranges, it is essential that further, more comprehensive, research is undertaken to re-confirm this finding and to explore other thermal situations in which it might apply.

While more respondents judged the nudges and the lanyard policy positively than negatively, there was substantial negative judgment and incomprehension for both with some employees finding the nudges paternalistic.

We compare the effects of point and density projections in a learning-to-forecast laboratory experiment where participantsâ€™ aggregated expectations about one- and two-period-ahead inflation influence macroeconomic dynamics. Precise point projections are more effective at managing inflation expectations. Point projections reduce disagreement and uncertainty while nudging participants to forecast rationally. Supplementing the point projection with a density forecast mutes many of these benefits. Relative to a point projection, density forecasts lead to larger forecast errors, greater uncertainty about own forecasts, and less credibility in the central bankâ€™s projections. We also explore expectation formation in individual-choice environments to understand the motives for responding to projections. Credibility in the projections is significantly lower when strategic considerations are absent, suggesting that projections are primarily effective as a coordination device. Overall, our results suggest that communicating uncertainty through density projections reduces the efficacy of inflation point projections.

Elisabeth C.;Staffordâ€Johnson, Natalie","Objectives: This Registered Report attempted to conceptually replicate the finding that communicating herd immunity increases vaccination intentions (Betsch, et al., 2017, Nat. Hum. Behav., 0056). An additional objective was to explore the roles of descriptive social norms (vaccination behaviour of others) and the herdâ€immunity threshold (coverage needed to stop disease transmission). Design: An online experiment with a 2 (herdâ€immunity explanation: present vs. absent) Ã— 3 (descriptive norm: high vs. low vs. absent) Ã— 2 (herdâ€immunity threshold: present vs. absent) betweenâ€subjects fractional design. Methods: Sample consisted of 543 people (aged 18â€“64) residing in the United Kingdom. Participants first received an explanation of herd immunity emphasising social benefits (protecting others) in both textual and animatedâ€infographic form. Next, they were faced with fictitious information about the disease, the vaccine, their countryâ€™s vaccination coverage (80% or 20%), and the herdâ€immunity threshold (90%). Vaccination intention was selfâ€rated. Results: Compared to the control, communicating social benefits of herd immunity was effective in increasing vaccination intentions ( F (1,541) = 6.97, p = .009, Partial Etaâ€Squared = 0.013). Communicating the descriptive norm or the herdâ€immunity threshold alongside the herdâ€immunity explanation demonstrated no observable effect. Conclusion: Communicating social benefits of herd immunity increased selfâ€reported vaccination intentions against a fictitious disease, replicating previous findings. Although this result is positive, the practical relevance may be limited. Further research into the effect of social nudges to motivate vaccination is required, particularly with respect to the recent pandemic context and varying levels of vaccine hesitancy.

The exploration of effective weight loss strategies is essential. Nudges are currently advancing approaches that represent a new and better method for changing the behaviors of people. However, the effectiveness of nudge interventions on weight loss in overweight people who may be obese has not been synthesized in a systematic manner. In this study, a systematic literature search was performed. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as summary statistics. In total, 25 RCTs involving a population of 5,929 individuals were included. Significant effects of the nudge strategy on weight loss (WMD: -0.96Â kg, 95% CI: -1.49 to -0.43), body mass index (WMD: -0.3Â kg/m2, 95% CI: -0.41 to -0.19) and waist circumference (WMD: -0.75Â cm, 95% CI: -1.23 to -0.27) were observed. The subgroup analysis showed that the reduction in body weight associated with nudge interventions was significant in younger and more obese people. Moreover, the effect of nudge intervention on weight loss weakened over time. Overall, the nudge strategy can promote changes in weight loss, body mass index and waist circumference of adults, albeit at a mild magnitude and in particular types of individuals.

Despite clinical guidelines and education, prescribing continues at a higher rate than before the opioids crisis. The objective of trial 1 of the Application of Economics & Social psychology to improve Opioid Prescribing Safety (AESOPS-1) is to discourage unnecessary opioid prescribing in primary care by applying â€œbehavioral insightsâ€â€”empirically-tested social and psychological interventions that affect choice. Methods: AESOPS-1 randomizes primary care clinics in Illinois and California to behavioral intervention or control. Both arms receive opioid guideline education. Clinics randomized to the behavioral intervention arm receive nudges within the electronic health record (EHR) including: 1) an â€œaccountable justificationâ€ entered in the chart, 2) a precommitment to address high-risk prescriptions, and 3) a â€œPainTrackerâ€ that broadens discussions about pain. The control arm receives no EHR-based intervention. The primary outcome is the change in weekly milligram morphine equivalents (MME) prescribed. The secondary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients prescribed at least 50 daily MME. To evaluate these outcomes, we will use a difference-in-differences mixed-effects regression model on clinician MME weekly or daily dose. The analysis will be â€œintent-to-treat.â€ The intervention period is 18-months, with a 6-month follow-up period to measure persistence of effects.

Because eating involves automatic routines, new approaches have emerged appealing to non-reflective cognitive processes. Through a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the impact of visual stimuli (positive and negative) on children's snack-choices at school. Results showed that the negative stimulus had no effect, while the positive stimulus increased the probability among girls of choosing a healthy snack. We also found that children with excess weight had a larger baseline probability of choosing the healthy snack than those without. We conclude that happy emojis, used to nudge non-reflective processes, can steer children towards healthy choices.

However, we do not yet fully understand how incentives and social information interact. We report two experiments examining how incentives and social information interact to induce behavior change. In the first experiment, the behavior of interest is punctuality in the field; in the second, we examine cooperation in a large-N prisonersâ€™ dilemma in the lab. In both experiments participants valued good behavior and believed others also valued it, yet only a minority behaved well. We find that incentives work in both environments, while information nudges were only effective in the prisonersâ€™ dilemma. Incentives complement information nudges only in the prisonersâ€™ dilemma.

We study a game, in which individuals are embedded in a social network and compete for a positional advantage with their direct neighbors by purchasing a positional good. In a series of experiments, we test four policy interventions to curb the consumption of the positional good. We manipulate the type of the intervention (either a nudge or a tax) and the number of individuals exposed to the intervention (either the most central network node or the entire network). We illustrate that, if the entire network is exposed to the intervention, both the nudge and the tax can serve as effective policy instruments to combat positional consumption. Nevertheless, taxing or nudging the most central network node does not seem to be equally effective due to the absence of spillover effects from the center to the other nodes. As for the mechanism through which the nudge operates, our findings are consistent with an explanation where nudging increases the psychological cost of the positional consumption.

In both individual and strategic decisions, we observe substantial gaps in performance between high reflective and low reflective participants. We also find that choice architecture and experience narrow these gaps in performance. Our primary finding is that experience serves as a substitute for cognitive reflection: Across a series of experiments employing multiple rounds of a lottery task, a second price sealed bid auction, an English clock auction, and a random serial dictatorship allocation mechanism, we consistently find that the performance of low reflection participants with experience is similar to that of high reflection participants without experience.

The paper presents the results of a field experiment with employees of a leading life and pensions company in Spain. The results of the experiment show that financial literacy and awareness of the importance of saving are not enough for individuals to act. Even with pension plan experts, the combination of two types of instruments is necessary: rational instruments, such as financial literacy and awareness of the economic implications of retirement, and nudging, which moves individuals to action in a meaningful way. In this case, an effective approach is to use the default option to increase long-term saving patterns. The Ahorra+ program, which was implemented in 2016 with 282 employees and in 2017 with 405 employees, significantly increases voluntary savings and helps people prepare for retirement.",Journal of Business Research,2020,10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.01.061,PsychInfo,,126,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5ua7PM0WIxs8re7ZikmvaNJOqBqKsL0/view?usp=sharing,jesusmaria.garcia@caixabankops.com; jose.e.vila@uv.es,Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,default effects on savings behavior,Y,,,#N/A,,N,,,,,,,,-,-,,Finance,Spain,,-,-,-,-,-,Not an RCT,N,-,0,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,Consensus,-

The gym is an environment rich in microorganisms, and careful hygiene is a necessity to keep infections at bay. Exercise centers strive for better hygiene compliance among their members. This effort has become essential in light of the current pandemic. Several experimental studies show that others' physical presence, or the ""illusion"" of being watched, may alter behavior. This article reports on a natural field experiment testing one specific social nudge intended to increase gym members' hygienic behavior. The study was conducted before the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. A picture of ""observing eyes"" was attached to paper dispensers and cleanser spray bottles at two different gyms in Norway. A reversal design, also called an ABA design, with and without the nudge's presence, was used to investigate the impact on gym members' hygienic behavior. A follow-up study was conducted in one of the centers to investigate whether the nudge stimuli would function over time. The study included 254 individual choice situations during nine observation sessions conducted over 9 weeks. The results from both centers provide evidence of a strong effect of the nudge. However, the effect decreased during the follow-up study. These findings support previous research indicating that human behavior is influenced by the presence of implicit observation cues – in this case – observing eyes. However, insights into the long-term effect of implicit observation cues are still needed since the salience of the stimuli faded over time.",Frontiers in Psychology,2020,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.603440,PsychInfo,,127,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7OTP1Quo6A9RDjaQp5hILhX3o7-7gqX/view?usp=sharing,hilde.mobekk@oslomet.no,Y,,Y,1,1,within-group design - ABAB design (reversal design),Y,1,testing the impact of 'watching eyes' on gym members' hygienic behavior,Y,,,#N/A,,N,,,,,,,,center,hand washing opportunities,,Health,Norway,,N,2,Y,N,N,"Test with 2 centers, both ABAB

In a randomized controlled trial, we found that behavioral economics interventions (opt-out testing and financial incentives) each improved HIV testing rates and these approaches are being implemented by several hospital systems. How- ever, it is unclear if these strategies are cost-effective. We quantified the cost-effectiveness of different behavioral approaches to HIV screening—opt-out testing, financial incentives, and their combination—in terms of cost per new HIV diagnosis and infections averted. We estimated the incremental number of new HIV diagnoses and program costs using a mathematical screening model, and infections averted using and HIV transmission model. We used a 1-year time horizon and a hospital perspective. Switching from opt-into opt-out results in 39 additional diagnoses (56% increase) after 1-year at a cost of $3807 per new diagnosis. Switching from no incentive to a $1, $5, or $10 incentive adds 14, 13, and 28 new diagnoses (20, 19, and 41% increases) at a cost of $11,050, $17,984, and $15,298 per new diagnosis, respectively. Layering on financial incentives to opt-out testing enhances program effectiveness, though at a greater marginal cost per diagnosis. We found a similar pattern for infections averted. This is one of the first cost-effectiveness analyses of behavioral economics interventions in public health. Changing the choice architecture from opt-into opt-out and giving financial incentives for testing are both cost-effective in terms of detecting HIV and reducing transmission. For hospitals interested in increasing HIV screening rates, changing the choice architecture is an efficient strategy and more efficient than incentives.",AIDS and Behavior,2020,10.1007/s10461-019-02425-8,PsychInfo,,129,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-L67MssQXtyoeEZc0FdyYJu0R0qngx1N/view?usp=sharing,zwagner@berkeley.edu,Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,tested impact of defaults vs. financial incentives on HIV test takeup ,Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,individuals,individuals,,Health,United States of America,,Y,12,Y,Y,Y,Note: this paper is just a cost-analysis of the RCT that is actually detailed in a separate published journal article from 2018.

Serious illness conversations (SICs) between clinicians and patients can help increase a patient's understanding of their prognosis, goals and values.
Methods and analysis: In this study, we describe the design of a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to evaluate the impact of an intervention that employs machine learning-based prognostic algorithms and beha- vioral nudges to prompt oncologists to have SICs with patients at high risk of short-term mortality. Data are collected on documented SICs, documented advance care planning discussions, and end-of-life care utilization (emergency room and inpatient admissions, chemotherapy and hospice utilization) for patients of all enrolled clinicians.
Conclusion: This trial represents a novel application of machine-generated mortality predictions combined with behavioral nudges in the routine care of outpatients with cancer. Findings from the trial may inform strategies to encourage early serious illness conversations and the application of mortality risk predictions in clinical settings.",Contemporary Clinical Trials,2020,10.1016/j.cct.2020.105951,ScienceDirect,,130,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OQkcNmQzxvcsQ8qhJ8zZcJ0b3aOPbDQ/view?usp=sharing,Christopher.manz@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,Y,,N,1,1,not yet run,Y,1,impact of nudges on likelihhod HCPs have serious illness conversations with cancer patients,Y,Between-subjects only,,#N/A,,N,not yet run,N,,,,,,clinic,patient,,Health,United States of America,-,-,2,Y,Y,N,"This paper isn't the final published results, it was just an update on what was going on at the time.

This study uses a randomized controlled trial research design to examine the effect of feedback and a social nudge in the form of peer comparison on energy consumption of non-ratepaying households. The study setting is a university family housing complex, and findings are based on hourly observations of energy use by 62 households over thirteen weeks. Our results suggest that neither feedback or peer comparison is an effective instrument to reduce energy use of non-ratepaying households, and may even increase energy consumption in some contexts. We find heterogeneous effects among households that are low and high users of energy in the pre-treatment period, with high users increasing energy consumption in response to feedback.

The main originality of our approach is that we test how a nudge can be used as an instrument to increase social acceptability, conveying objective information regarding ash recycling. Furthermore, although we do not consider it as a welfare measure, we show how the estimation of the willingness-to-pay can be considered as a complement to the more traditional social acceptability measure. Three nudges were introduced as three treatments in a discrete choice experiment. In the first treatment, the options with wood ash application were highlighted to indicate to the respondents that they corresponded to pro-environmental measures (positive framing). In the second treatment, we changed the wording of the two non-status quo options to highlight the recycling aspect of wood ash application. In the last treatment, we adopted a productive wording to highlight the fact that wood ash application increases wood production. Treatments, in particular positive framing and productive wording, influence the willingness-to-pay but depend on the attitudes of the respondents.",Ecological Economics,2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106748,ScienceDirect,,134,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmuFqw0ZMl522W0Tjyr7EtmxxR1AY8pv/view?usp=sharing,"benjamin.ouvrard@inrae.fr, jens.abildtrup@inrae.fr, anne.stenger-letheux@inrae.fr",Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,,,,,#N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,Environment/Energy,France,,,-,,N,-,,,N,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,-

The first intervention aims to nudge participants to higher contribution levels by labeling contributions above a particular threshold as being â€œgoodâ€. Such a â€œnorm-nudgeâ€ is intended to provide subjects with a clear, valenced focal point upon which they can coordinate. The second intervention aims to exploit lying aversion to induce higher contributions by requiring subjects to announce how much they contributed. We find that the nudge leads to a striking increase in the cooperation rate. By contrast, the ex post announcement mechanism does not have a significant effect on the cooperation rate. We present suggestive evidence that the nudge we use provides subjects with a focal point, helping conditional cooperators to coordinate their contributions.",Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics,2020,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2020.101542,ScienceDirect,,136,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vp82GYSoUjUgsVJJSheu70jEZzUsSMnz/view?usp=sharing,"kai.barron@wzb.eu, tuomas.nurminen@hanken.fi",Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,Public good games with nudge,Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,individuals,individuals,,EconomicGames,Not Reported,-,N,4,,N,-,"Conditions:

Quick failed,not a nudge experiment - purely pricing,Linnea G.,,,4/2/23,Optimizing price menus for duration discounts: A subscription selectivity field experiment,"Tian, Longxiu;Feinberg, Fred M.","Subscription services typically offer duration discounts , rewarding longer commitments with lower per-period costs. The â€œmenuâ€of contract plan prices must be balanced to encourage potential customers to select into subscription overall and to nudge those that do to more profitable contracts. Because subscription menu prices change infrequently, they are difficult to optimize using historical pricing data alone. We propose that firms solve this problem via an experiment and a model that jointly accounts for whether to opt in and, conditionally, which plan to choose. To that end, we conduct a randomized online pricing experiment that orthogonalizes the â€œelevationâ€and â€œsteepnessâ€ of price menus for a major dating pay site. Usersâ€™optin and plan choice decisions are analyzed using a novel model for correlated binary selection and multinomial conditional choice, estimated via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Benchmark comparisons suggest that common models of consumer choice may systematically misestimate price substitution patterns, and that a key consideration is the distinctiveness of the opt-out (e.g., non- subscription) option relative to others available. Our model confirms several anticipated pricing effects (e.g., on the margin, raising prices discourages both opt-in overall and choice of any higher-priced plans), but also some that alternative models fail to capture, most notably that across-the-board pricing increases have a far lower negative impact than standard random-utility models would imply. Joint optimization of the menuâ€™s component prices suggests the firm has set them too low overall, particularly so for its longest-duration plan.

Here, we investigated the psychological mechanisms that underlie and drive the directional effects of attribute translations on decision making. Across two choice experiments (total N = 973), we provide empirical support for our proposition that attribute translations operate via pre-decisional attention processes.

In addition to the cognitive mechanisms underlying attribute translations, we highlight the choice architectural principles that moderate the effectiveness of translations. We show that the directional effects of attribute translations are driven by the information that translations provide rather than by contextual changes in the decision environment.

Because past research on antecedents of unethical behavior has not provided a clear answer, we turned to machine learning to generate novel hypotheses. We trained a deep-learning model to predict whether or not World Values Survey respondents perceived unethical behaviors as justifiable, on the basis of their responses to 708 other items. The model identified optimism about the future of humanity as one of the top predictors of unethicality. A preregistered correlational study ( N = 218 U.S. residents) conceptually replicated this finding. A preregistered experiment ( N = 294 U.S. residents) provided causal support: Participants who read a scenario conveying optimism about the COVID-19 pandemic were less willing to justify hoarding and violating social-distancing guidelines than participants who read a scenario conveying pessimism. The findings suggest that optimism can help reduce unethicality, and they document the utility of machine-learning methods for generating novel hypotheses.

The corrections listed in the Corrigendum are being made to the original article, not the in-progress version.] This article provides the first test of the decoy effect as a nudge to influence real-world behavior. The decoy effect is the phenomenon that an additional but worse option can boost the appeal of an existing option. It has been widely demonstrated in hypothetical choices, but its usefulness in real-world settings has been subject to debate. In three longitudinal experiments in food-processing factories, we tested two decoy sanitation options that were worse than the existing sanitizer spray bottle. Results showed that the presence of a decoy, but not an additional copy of the original sanitizer bottle in a different color, drastically increased food workersâ€™ hand sanitizer use from the original sanitizer bottle and, consequently, improved workersâ€™ passing rate in hand sanitation tests from 60% to 70% to above 90% for 20 days. These findings indicate that the decoy effect can be a powerful nudge technique to influence real-world behavior.

Life cycle analysis (LCA) computes environmental impacts across several indicators and throughout the life cycle stages of a product or a service. However, its capacity to grasp human behaviours and their changes is limited. This is especially true when one wishes to assess the potential benefits of behavioural policies based on peopleâ€™s irrationality such as nudges. This article describes a methodology for the environmental assessment of systems and policies that aim to change human behaviours. To that end, agent-based modeling (ABM) and LCA are combined. While ABM simulates human behaviours and their changes, LCA assess environmental impacts. The methodology is applied to a case study of standard and smart homes use phases. Results show that attitudinal factors such as conformity to others cause significant effectsâ€”up to approximately 30% of environmental benefits in the experimentsâ€”and should therefore be accounted for. When performing peak shaving (a shift in time of part of the electricity load), the use of a photovoltaic (PV) battery system increases the reductions in climate change impact by up to roughly 25%. However, peak shaving may also lead to environmental trade-offs depending on the metric used. These results show the relevance of combining LCA and ABM when evaluating systems or policies that change peopleâ€™s behaviours (e.g., nudges). The proposed methodology could enable the assessment of complex systems in sustainable consumption. Evaluating other such systems (e.g., mobility or diet) also constitutes a possible application of the developed approach.",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,2019,10.1016/j.rser.2019.05.038,ScienceDirect,,156,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZyrvJgVXFcZb4d_OLC3KKDYISZc5ds4-/view?usp=sharing,julien.walzberg@polymtl.ca,N,,Y,1,1,Mohamed Cheriet had another article retracted - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494616302514,N,1,Experiment to test whether behavioural nudges in smart home devices will reduce energy use,,,,#N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,Environment/Energy,Canada,,,-,,N,-,,,-,0,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,-

Recycled water has emerged as a potentially safe and cost-effective way to replace or supplement traditional irrigation water. However, adoption of recycled water by U.S. agricultural producers has been modest, in part, because of concerns that consumers will be reluctant to accept their products. Our results suggest that simple processing of foods such as drying or liquefying can relieve some of consumersâ€™ concerns about use of recycled irrigation water. While consumers of processed foods are indifferent between irrigation with recycled and conventional water, they are less willing to pay for fresh foods irrigated with recycled water relative to conventional water. We also found that consumers would experience a welfare gain from a labeling policy communicating the use of recycled irrigation water on both processed and fresh foods. Our analysis further reveals that informational nudges that provide consumers with messages about benefits, risks, and both the benefits and risks of using recycled water have no statistically significant effect on consumersâ€™ willingness to pay for fresh and processed foods irrigated with recycled water relative to a no-information control group.",Food Policy,2019,10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.101748,ScienceDirect,202,163,Yes,https://drive.google.com/file/d/16YFcElhIPGS5Lapm17kjfVcm0oMh34WR/view?usp=sharing,messer@udel.edu (K.D.

In an experiment conducted among 115 children (aged between 7 and 12 years), whose gender and levels of environmental perception before the experiment were controlled for, we show that applying an â€˜eco-friendlyâ€™ label is sufficient to trigger more subsequent intentions to behave ecologically than what was observed in the control group. We also provide evidence that the most effective age for using this nudge is above 10. Our results show that the intentions to behave ecologically persist a week after labelling. This on-going effect suggests that the influence of social labelling is not limited to the immediate response. An ethical discussion on the issue closes the paper.

One line of argument in favour of nudging is based on empirical findings, according to which a healthy majority among the public support nudges. In this paper, we show, based on an experiment we conducted, that, in health-related choices, peopleâ€™s ethical attitudes to nudging are strongly affected by the point of view from which the nudge is considered. Significant differences have been found between doctorsâ€™ ethical attitude to clinical nudging and that of patients. We show how these differences weaken the argument for nudging from public support.

Quick failed,fails sample size and reality,Linnea G.,,,4/5/23,Nudging with construal level theory to improve online password use and intended password choice: A security-usability tradeoff perspective,"Kaleta, Jeffrey P.;Lee, Jong Seok;Yoo, Sungjin","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on a potential tradeoff between security and usability in peopleâ€™s use of online passwordsâ€”in general, complex passwords are secure and desirable but difficult to use (i.e. difficult to memorize) whereas simple passwords are easy to use, but are insecure and undesirable. Construal level theory (CLT) explains how high vs low construal level causes people to focus on â€œdesirabilityâ€ vs â€œfeasibilityâ€ of an action, which in the research context can translate into the â€œsecurityâ€ vs â€œusabilityâ€ of using passwords. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a series of three laboratory experiments manipulating peopleâ€™s construal level and investigating its impact on password use. Findings: The authors found that people who were induced to think at a high construal level created or showed intention to choose stronger passwords relative to people who were induced to think at a low construal level. Furthermore, this effect was also significantly different from the control group who did not receive any experimental treatment. In addition, the authors found that perspective taking targeted at the desirability of creating a strong password further strengthened the effect of a high construal level on intended password choice. Originality/value: This research makes several contributions to existing literature on password security. First, this research offers CLT as a theoretical lens to explain an individualâ€™s thinking and behavior concerning online password use. Second, this research offers empirical evidence that a high construal level improves usersâ€™ password use, a desirable feature for improved security.

Whether children also make partition dependent decisions is unknown, as are potential patterns of developmental change. In this experiment ( N = 159), we examined whether children exhibit partition dependence using a novel resource allocation task. This novel task, distributing food tokens to zoo animals, did elicit partition dependence in our developmental sample. Both older children (ages 7-10 years) and younger children (ages 3-6 years) made partition dependent allocations, and younger children exhibited a larger partition dependence effect than did older children. This work provides the first evidence that childrenâ€™s decisions, like adultsâ€™, are influenced by the arbitrary grouping of the options, and suggests that younger children may be more susceptible to this influence, at least in the context explored here.

P.; Archer, S.; Pilling, M.; Kenny, M.; Hollands, G. J.; Marteau, T. M.","There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of choice architecture or â€˜nudgeâ€™ interventions to change a range of behaviours including the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and food. Public acceptability is key to implementing these and other interventions. However, few studies have assessed public acceptability of these interventions, including the extent to which acceptability varies with the type of intervention, the target behaviour and with evidence of intervention effectiveness. These were assessed in an online study using a between-participants full factorial design with three factors: Policy (availability vs size vs labelling vs tax) x Behaviour (alcohol consumption vs tobacco use vs high-calorie snack food consumption) x Evidence communication (no message vs assertion of policy effectiveness vs assertion and quantification of policy effectiveness [e.g., a 10% change in behaviour]). Participants (Nâ€¯=â€¯7058) were randomly allocated to one of the 36 groups. The primary outcome was acceptability of the policy. Acceptability differed across policy, behaviour and evidence communication (all psâ€¯<â€¯.001). Labelling was the most acceptable policy (supported by 78%) and Availability the least (47%). Tobacco use was the most acceptable behaviour to be targeted by policies (73%) compared with policies targeting Alcohol (55%) and Food (54%). Relative to the control group (60%), asserting evidence of effectiveness increased acceptability (63%); adding a quantification to this assertion did not significantly increase this further (65%). Public acceptability for nudges and taxes to improve population health varies with the behaviour targeted and the type of intervention but is generally favourable. Communicating that these policies are effective can increase support by a small but significant amount, suggesting that highlighting effectiveness could contribute to mobilising public demand for policies. While uncertainty remains about the strength of public support needed, this may help overcome political inertia and enable action on behaviours that damage population and planetary health.",Social Science & Medicine,2019,,ScienceDirect,,182,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dWMCBZ4O-kZmL3Htw0Zpn9cMS2hbfRk0/view?usp=sharing,tm388@medschl.cam.ac.uk,Y,,Y,,,,,,,,,,#N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,Health,United Kingdom,,,-,,N,-,,,-,0,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,-

However, to be a useful policy tool, nudges should have stable, predictable impacts on targeted behaviours. In this paper, we use a randomized experiment to test one specific nudge, namely the communication of a descriptive social norm. The paper examines whether the effects of such a nudge on stated preferences for household recycling are indeed stable and predictable in terms of household willingness to pay for waste collection contracts requiring more recycling effort by households. Three aspects of the social norm are varied: its absolute level, the geographic proximity, and whether relative performance information is included. We find that while respondents generally respond positively to social norm information, the effect is not necessarily monotonic, with the highest social norm levels not necessarily being the most effective, in fact discouraging some respondents from sorting. In addition, whether and how respondents react to the social norm information strongly depends on their current engagement level, with respondents who sort a lot reacting in a negative manner.",Resource and Energy Economics,2019,11,ScienceDirect,,184,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/16THfQObhx4bZI94ik6qJ7bLGYfruUPaO/view?usp=sharing,"mc@uw.edu.pl, kzagorska@wne.uw.edu.pl, nicholas.hanley@glasgow.ac.uk",Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,,Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,individuals,individuals,,Environment/Energy,Poland,,N,8,,N,-,"8 conditions, N=1853 individuals",,-,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,No behavioral outcomes,,,,,,,,,N,,-

We are concerned with achieving societal well-being from a selection-of-cultures perspective, and we call for increasing synergies between the 2 fields. The original experiment achieved a 20% reduction in food waste among restaurant customers by implementing 2 independent nudges: reducing plate size and socially approving multiple servings. We use this experiment as an example to introduce an analysis of the social contingencies (metacontingencies) responsible for not only establishing but also maintaining sustainable behavioral repertoires. We show how reducing food waste can be a simple, economic, effective example of a behavioral intervention when programmed with contingencies of cooperation. Furthermore, we generalize our model to social architectures that create and sustain cultural practices. Namely, our model addresses the long-term effects of nudging as a result of cooperation between stakeholders and how these effects are maintained by feedback loops. Whereas the aggregate effect of individual choice behavior can affect food consumption significantly, it may not suffice to change an enduring cultural practice. We argue that a behavior-analytic approach in studying complex systems informs nudging applications at the policy-making level.

One sort of intervention that could potentially shift balance between short-term and long-term consequences is instructed mental simulation. Mental simulations could be characterised as images or can be embodied, as a complete experience, including body sensations, feelings and images. We examine systematic differences in two types of instructed mental simulation: imagining the moment of consumption (process) and post-consumption (outcome), and emphasise the importance of product type (vice, virtue) on its effect on wanting and choice. In a within-subject experiment, 76 participants were allocated to the two mental simulation conditions (happening in different sessions) and imagined consuming or having consumed a vice and a virtue product. After imagining each product, the participants rated their level of wanting and indicated the product they preferred: the vice or the virtue one. The results showed that imagining the consumption of the vice product or the post-consumption of the virtue product increased the rate of wanting for the correspondent product, the same pattern was found for preferences. Furthermore, results showed that health orientation moderated the effect of mental simulation on wanting and choice. Further knowledge in different simulation types may have important implications for understanding how we represent food in our mind and help with the development of effective communicational interventions that nudge people towards healthier food choices.

Posters asking individuals to use less paper are pasted on printers (Times) and in office cubicles (Umendall) of two information technology firms around New Delhi, India. A third firm (India Mart) does not get the nudge and serves as our control. During the nudge period, employees of the firms that get the conservation message on average expend a significantly lower number of sheets per day as compared to the pre-nudge period, measured both in terms of paper used and paper wasted. Furthermore, after the nudge is removed, the per capita paper wastage for one of the firms that received it (Times) does not increase significantly over the next month and a half, whereas for the other firm (Umendall) it does but remains significantly lower than the per capita wastage in the pre-nudge period. In terms of total paper used, the nudged firms show a reduction in the number of sheets used several weeks after the nudge is removed. For the control firm, the wastage and usage of printer paper does not change significantly over the duration of the experiment.

Quick failed,"fail, hypothetical",Linnea G.,,,4/6/23,Welfare effects of nudges: The emotional tax of calorie menu labeling,"ThunstrÃ¶m, Linda","Traditionally, information has been assumed to never harm consumers, a notion recently challenged. Salience nudges have been argued to evoke negative emotions, therefore acting as â€œemotional taxesâ€. I design a hypothetical restaurant meal experiment to analyze the emotional and short-term consumer welfare impact of a calorie salience nudge (calorie menu labeling)â€”a policy implemented nationwide in the U.S. in 2018. I find that a calorie salience nudge may act as an emotional tax, but only for someâ€”there is considerable heterogeneity in the emotional response to the nudge. In particular, the nudge emotionally taxes people with low eating self-control, while it emotionally subsidizes those with higher levels of eating self-control. It therefore emotionally taxes the â€œrightâ€ people. However, people with lower levels of self-control may experience fewer benefits from the nudgeâ€”the nudge causes them to adjust their high calorie meal consumption by less than do those with higher self-control. It is therefore unsurprising that consumers with lower self-control attach a lower (a negative) value to the calorie salience nudge. Overall, the calorie salience nudge positively affects consumer welfare, although heterogeneity over consumers is substantial â€“ the consumer value ranges from positive to negative. I find no distributional effects over income from the calorie salience nudge.

However, the available evidence regarding the effect of DoD on food choices is limited, and little is known about the conditions of its effectiveness in the field. This study investigates the effect of introducing DoD options in a real self-service restaurant setting on the selection of vegetable-rich options. The objectives are to (1) replicate and measure the DoD effect in this situation; and (2) investigate the moderating role of two features of the choice set: (i) the type of option set as DoD and (ii) the number of alternatives options to choose from. In a living lab experiment, 294 consumers came for lunch to a self-service restaurant and chose between a target vegetable-based dish (vg1) and respectively one, or two, alternatives: a meat-based dish (nvg) and another vegetable dish (vg2). Five choice task conditions were tested, in a between-subjects design: three conditions examined dish choices when two options were available (vg1 versus nvg): no DoD (T1-0); vg1 as DoD (T1a); or nvg as DoD (T1b). Two further conditions used three options (vg1 versus nvg versus vg2): no nudge (T2-0), or vg1 as DoD (T2a). In neutral conditions T1-0 and T2-0 respectively, 34.4% and 23.3% of consumers chose vg1. The DoD effect was observed in all conditions: choices in favour of vg1 increased by 25.2% when in was DoD by 25.2% in T1a vs. T1-0 and by 30% in T2a vs T2-0; while 7.6% more consumers chose nvg in T1b vs T1-0. Regarding the conditions of DoD effectiveness, the size of the DoD effect was larger for the initially less popular dish vg1 (T1a) compared with nvg (T1b). Introducing more options also increased the relative effect of DoD in favour of vg1, from 73% (T1a) to 129% (T2a). There were no effects of the condition on consumer satisfaction with the dish chosen, nor on the amount of food wasted.

This study determines whether adding smaller portion sizes to a retailerâ€™s assortment unobtrusively encourages consumers to buy smaller portions. Therefore, a field experiment with meat sausage as focal product, was conducted over the course of a month in a branch of a large European retailer, generating receipts of each individual shopping trip. The product sales data revealed slightly more sales of the two smaller portions in terms of units (52%), versus the default, larger portion (48%), resulting in a pertinent reduction in total volumes sold in kg. Furthermore, a two-way ANOVA comparing sales at the individual level before and during the intervention for the experimental store versus eight control stores showed a reduction in the volume of meat sold during the intervention period in the experimental store. Moreover, the results of a one-way ANOVA indicated that smaller portion buyers do not compensate by buying more other products within the same product category. The finding that adding smaller portions to a default choice architecture can nudge consumers towards buying smaller sized items, has important implications for retailers and public policy makers involved in promoting healthy and sustainable consumer behavior.

Experiment 2 (N = 124) extended this research to a naturalistic dining context, demonstrating the influence of both plating arrangement (horizontal vs. vertical) and centrality (centred vs. offset plating) on the same ratings. In both experiments, the plate of food was rated as constituting a larger portion when the elements were arrayed-horizontally rather than stacked vertically. Additionally, the centrally-plated dessert was rated as a larger portion than the offset version of exactly the same dish. The food was also liked more and the participants/diners were willing to pay more for it when horizontally and/or centrally arranged.

Indeed, users are frequently given insufficient guidance to enable effective security choices and decisions, which can lead to perceived bad behaviour as a consequence. This paper discusses the forms of support that are possible, and seeks to investigate the effect of doing so in practice. Specifically, it presents findings from two experimental studies that investigate how variations in password meter usage and feedback can positively affect the resulting password choices. The first experiment examines the difference between passwords selected by unguided users and those receiving guidance and alternative forms of feedback (ranging from a traditional password meter through to an emoji-based approach). The findings reveal a 30% drop in weak password choices between unguided and guided usage, with the varying meters then delivering up to 10% further improvement. The second experiment then considers variations in the form of feedback message that users may receive in addition to a meter-based rating. It is shown that by providing richer information (e.g. based upon the time required to crack a password, its relative ranking against other choices, or the probability of it being cracked), users are more motivated towards making strong choices and changing initially weak ones. While the specifics of the experimental findings were focused upon passwords, the discussion also considers the benefits that may be gained by applying the same principles of nudging and guidance to other areas of security in which users are often found to have weak behaviours.",Computers & Security,2018,10.1016/j.cose.2018.01.016,ScienceDirect,,204,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O4oX755NMzIzBHJ7ZqKTdQsAmAn5qMUb/view?usp=sharing,steven.furnell@plymouth.ac.uk,Y,,Y,2,2,,Y,1,Experiment to see if guided vs unguided users result in different passwords - not primary! reporting from another primary source,Y,,,#N/A,,Y,,,,,,,,individuals,individuals,,Privacy/Security/Crime,Not Reported,-,N,5,Y,N,N,"Conditions:

To evaluate the impact of food bundling, we conduct an artefactual field experiment with community participants in a laboratory set up as a grocery store. Dual-self theory suggests that food choices may differ depending on whether shoppers are under cognitive loadâ€”in our experiment, we exogenously vary whether bundles are displayed (with and without a price discount) and whether shoppers are under cognitive load. Our findings align with prior studies that suggest unhealthy options are more likely to be selected when cognitive resources are constrained. When bundles are displayed, we observe increased F&amp;V purchasing. We also observe a significant interaction between cognitive load and price discounting. We find discounted bundles are more effective in the absence of cognitive load, but non-discounted bundles are more effective when shoppers are under cognitive load. Although more research is warranted, our findings suggest that when shopping under cognitive load, it is possible that discounts impose additional cognitive strain on the shopping experience.

Yet, distributional effects of nudges are largely unknown. We first design an economic laboratory experiment to examine the incidence of an opportunity cost reminder nudge (a salience nudge) designed to curb spending, while accounting for heterogeneity in emotional responsesâ€”specifically the pain of paying. Pain of paying is optimal for â€˜unconflictedâ€™ consumers, but too low for â€˜spendthriftsâ€™ and too high for â€˜tightwadsâ€™, causing sub-optimal spending. Our empirical results imply the nudge increases pain of paying for tightwads, thereby reducing spending by tightwads, who already spend too little, while it entirely fails to reduce the spending of those who would have benefited from a spending reduction (spendthrifts). Overall, the nudge therefore might reduce consumer welfare. We next examine if the adverse impact of the opportunity cost reminder nudge is explained by a general tendency for all nudges to exacerbate peoplesâ€™ underlying spending preferences. We specifically test whether a salience nudge designed to boost spending correspondingly adversely affects spendthrifts? We unexpectedly find that subjects perceive the spending booster nudge as a â€œspending reminderâ€, which again, reduces spending by tightwads only, while not affecting spending by the other consumer types. Our results highlight two important aspects of salience nudgesâ€”given the complexity of consumer emotions and information processing, salience nudges can have undesired welfare effects, and the direction of their impact may be the opposite of what was intended.

The field experiment was set up as a between-groups study contrasting effects of three persuasive strategies (nudging, gamification, and health framing), plus active controls, on travel behavior during 1 month. Each sub-intervention constituted theory-informed approximations of common practices in each influence strategy, implemented by a marketing bureau based, on our instructions. Groups were assigned based on comparable places of residence rather than through true randomization. Both behavioral and self-reported psychological variables were measured, formally making this an exploratory multi-method field quasi experiment. Nine towns with comparable populations and travel distances to/from the main regional hub were identified by the regional bus operator as recruitment bases of interest. A total of 282 participants (101 identified male, 177 female, 4 other/rather not say) aged 15â€“65 (M = 42.53, SD = 12.98) participated in the experiment. The authors pitted the three popular behavioral change approaches of gamification, nudging, and health framing against controls to test which, if any, would be more effective at persuading car commuters to travel by bus during one month with a free bus pass. No single persuasive strategy significantly beat out the others, or the controls, on number of card swipes over a month. As such, we could not confirm our main hypothesis: that active persuasive strategies would lead to significantly more bus commuting compared to simply handing out free travel cards. A methodological caveat is that assignees to the gamification and nudge groups also had the shortest average travel distances. Although travel distance did not correlate with number of swipes in the overall sample, some between-group differences may be mediated by factors relating to varying attractiveness of bus travel depending on ease and convenience factors undetectable in the current design.

The web exercise, however, neither raises interest in personal finance issues nor significantly increases basic financial knowledge. The documentary movie did not affect attitudes towards saving or private credits.

Quick failed,fails hypothetical,Linnea G.,,,4/6/23,Social nudging: The effect of social feedback interventions on vaccine uptake,"Korn, Lars;Betsch, Cornelia;BÃ¶hm, Robert;Meier, Nicolas W.","Objective: Most vaccines provide indirect community protection by preventing the transmission of the disease. Paradoxically, this effect can also motivate omission of vaccination because increasing vaccination rates reduce the risk of infection and, therefore, the individual benefit of vaccination. Consequently, vaccination becomes a social dilemma where individualsâ€™ interests conflict with group interests. The current study investigated two social nudge interventions aiming to increasing individualsâ€™ motivation to act in the groupâ€™s interest. Rewarding the attainment of the goal (disease elimination) is hypothesized to increase goal-directed behavior (vaccination). Further, it is assumed that comparisons with another group increase cooperative vaccination within oneâ€™s own group. Method: In a laboratory experiment, the interactive vaccination (I-Vax) game was used to model the direct and indirect effects of vaccinations. The game was played by 288 participants over 20 rounds. The experimental setup varied the feedback information after each round to implement a 2 (rewarding goal-attainment: present vs. absent) Ã— 2 (intergroup comparison: present vs. absent) between-subjects design. Results: Analyses revealed the expected positive effect of rewarding goal-attainment, which was particularly strong at the beginning and weakened over the course of repeated decisions. The effect of intergroup comparisons was also positive but did not reach conventional criteria of statistical significance. Conclusions: The current experiment shows that communicating and rewarding â€œsmall winsâ€ may increase individualsâ€™ willingness to act in the groupâ€™s interest. Intergroup processes deserve further attention and investigation as potential strategies for improving vaccine communication and advocacy.

One of the top worldwide health problems is overweight and obesity, Body weight gain over a number of years could be achieved through cumulative positive energy balances, which may be the result of habitual behaviors adopted through personal choice. Despite the increased in physical activity, the percentage of people who are overweight has increased, after decades-old efforts and awareness on the issue to nudge consumers towards healthier lifestyles through dietary guidelines, diet-related diseases are still on the rise. Is there potential variables need to be evaluated for any relation with gaining weight and obesity in the patient's life styles?
Objectives
Exploration of the possible factors in the life style of overweight and obese patients, resulting in weight gain.
Patients and Methods
A prospective randomized study including 440 overweight or obese patients from a total of 689 patients, who consulted for advice, diet and or drugs and various bariatric operations. This was conducted in the period of 5 years from January 2, 2012 to October 1, 2017. For the information collection, each patient was interviewed face-to-face, by three Surgical Board Trainees were interviewing patients face-to-face to fill an originally-designed questionnaire in English translated to the Kurdish language. The questionnaire was composed of demographic data, medical data, biological data, and potential factors of their overweight or obesity. A comparison was made between these patients in the conception of case matching to 446 patients who were of normal body weight, and a normal BMI.
Results
Most of the patients (females; nÂ =Â 200, 86.95% and males; nÂ =Â 167, 79.52%) in group A, while (females; nÂ =Â 14, 5.90% and males; nÂ =Â 21, 10.05%) were drinking water within 30Â min after every meals, meanwhile (females; nÂ =Â 202, 85.23%, and males; nÂ =Â 173, 82.77%) from group B patients were drinking water 60Â min after every meals. Nearly half of the patients have a Television in their kitchen/dining room (nÂ =Â 239/440, 54.39%), however only (51.59%), (13.90%) of the patients from group A, and B respectively were watching TV while eating, A great number of the patients (Group A: nÂ =Â 358, 81.36%) were operating their computers while eating, versus minority (nÂ =Â 53, 11.88%), in Group B, and majority of the patients in group A were using their smart phones or making phone calls while eating (nÂ =Â 390/440, 88.63%) versus small number (nÂ =Â 49/460, 10.65%) in group B.
Conclusion
Excessive habitual usage of a cell phone, early drinking (within 30Â min) of water or other liquids after meals may be the potential factors in the initiation of becoming overweight and obese. University students living in the areas where entertainments are not affordable for all, the only remaining entertainment is using cellphones for social media and communication may be more vulnerable to gain weight, overweight and obesity.",International Journal of Surgery Open,2018,,ScienceDirect,0,215,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eUqBHy95T_lO2qJ5k6C7nt5fM8wRA-Vb/view?usp=sharing,"hatwan@gmail.com, Mahdikai@univsul.edu.iq, drsabah_hawrami@yahoo.com, Mohammad218@gmail.com, dr.ari_majeed@yahoo.com, Adib.fryad@yahoo.com, saiwandawdi@gmail.com, Karw87@yahoo.com",Y,,Y,,,"Retraction for Saiwen Hameed Ahmed and Ahmed, Hiwa Omer but this is due to the article accidentally being duplicated by journal so it is OK - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405857219300518 ",Y,-,-,N,,,#N/A,,-,,-,,,,,,-,-,,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,0,-,,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,N,,-

A combination of technology penetration, individual behaviour, community actions and policy interventions is driving such experiments. Ongoing investments in infrastructure are targeted towards creation of new facilities as well as modernisation of existing, and traditionally sustainable practices such as public transport, shared mobility, walking, cycling and rickshaw rides. Policies, supplemented by statutory mandates, are trying to command and regulate, nudge and incentivise climate responsive actions. Shifting public preferences towards star-rated household appliances is emerging as a social norm. Increased concern towards local air pollution is also driving changes. Large construction projects are being mandated to comply with building codes. Urban rooftops are facing competing demand from solar panels, organic gardens.

His foundational work showed that, in some settings, policies could induce groups to reduce their nonpoint source (NPS) pollution to socially-efficient levels. Poeâ€™s earlier studies assumed firms were homogeneous, which laid the groundwork for subsequent research to investigate the effect of firm heterogeneity on policy outcomes. We build on the research foundation laid by Poe and his colleagues by using an economic experiment to test the effects of four types of firm heterogeneity and three social norm information treatments on the performance of an ambient tax/subsidy policy. Our experimental results show that heterogeneity reduces the effectiveness of the ambient tax/subsidy policy, but that information nudges can improve outcomes even when there is considerable heterogeneity in the policy environment.

K.","Enterprises nudge the usage of mobile devices to ensure business continuity, although this tends to amplify corporate security risks. Consequently, corporations adopt Enterprise Mobile Systems (EMS) to facilitate employees working from home, ensuring security and privacy. Notwithstanding the business benefits of EMS, the adoption rate of these solutions by employees is significantly low. Traditional theories on technology adoption do not explain why some employees choose to use EMS through their mobile devices to access official applications, while others refrain. This study uses construal level theory and rational choice theory to examine the role of use contexts and intention to comply with EMS policy on employees' decision to adopt EMS. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was applied.

Low-cost message-based interventions are increasingly used to promote target behaviours. While growing evidence shows that such â€˜nudgesâ€™ often significantly impact behaviour, understanding of why interventions work or fail in particular contexts remains underdeveloped. In a natural field experiment conducted before the 2015 UK general election, we varied messages on a postcard sent by Oxford City Council to unregistered students encouraging them to join the electoral register. Our primary finding from the field study is that just one of our interventionsâ€”a reminder that people failing to register may be finedâ€”has a significant positive impact. Offering small monetary rewards to register instead has a negative but insignificant effect. In a second study, using an online experiment we identify a particular mechanism explaining the influence of this intervention. Specifically, we show that our interventions have divergent effects on perceptions of the normative appropriateness of registering: emphasising that failing to register is punishable by law strengthened the perception that one ought to register, while offering monetary inducements for registering weakened the perception that doing so is an action already expected within society.

However, due to lacking communication and knowledge of survivor pensions among workers, and also due to the lack of transparent products and choice architecture, redistribution remains limited. This paper uses a stated preferences experiment that is explicitly designed for workers with a partner in the age group of 55 to 65 years to elicit their pension redistribution preferences. We find that, on average, the preferred pension wealth redistribution amounts to 50%. 35% of all individuals have such a preference. 33% of all individuals would prefer less redistribution, and 32% percent prefers to redistribute more pension income to the partner upon one's death. We further show that total family income during working life does not affect the redistribution to survivor pensions. However, the distribution of the contribution to total family income before retirement across partners, as well as the survival likelihood of the partner and the number of years the partner is expected to survive, have a significant causal impact on the preferred pension redistribution decision. The preference for redistribution to survivor pensions also depends significantly on personal characteristics, preferences and social attitude. Males have a significantly stronger preference for redistribution compared to females. Moreover, forward-looking, more risk averse and more altruistic individuals have a stronger preference to redistribute part of their pension wealth to a survivor pension. Finally, in particular when employees have the perception that their partner is more forward looking, they are willing to invest more in a survivor pension.

Across four treatments, participants received one random truthful norm-nudge that emphasized â€˜moral suasion based on either what other participants previously did (empirical message) or approved of doing (normative message) and varied in the framing (positive or negative) in which it was presented. Subsequently, participants repeatedly played the â€˜mind gameâ€™ in which they were first asked to think of a number, then rolled a digital die, and then reported whether the two numbers coincide, in which case a bonus was paid. Hence, whether or not the report was truthful remained unobservable to the experimenters. We find compelling null effects with tight confidence intervals showing that none of the norm-nudge interventions worked. A follow-up experiment reveals the reason for these convincing null-effects: the information norm-nudges did not actually change norms. Notably, our secondary results suggest that a substantial portion of individuals misremembered norm-nudges such that they conveniently supported deviant behavior. This subset of participants indeed displayed significantly higher deviance levels, a behavior pattern in line with literature on motivated misremembering and belief distortion. We discuss the importance of this high-powered null finding for the flourishing norm-nudge literature and derive policy implications.

Methods: In this mixed-method real-life experiment, nudges were added weekly over a period of four consecutive weeks: placement of (1) Food Triangle posters in the restaurant, (2) â€˜green heartâ€™ icons above the fruit stands, and (3) substitution and (4) social norm messages at the fruit stands. During baseline (no intervention) and all intervention weeks, dessert sales were registered. Short interviews were used to ask customers about their perceptions regarding the intervention. Follow-up measurements (7 and 30 weeks later) evaluated the longer-term effectiveness, while all nudges remained in place. Dessert sales were analyzed separately for both sexes, students and staff categories (based on academic degree). Results: Compared to baseline, the combination of the Food Triangle and the green heart intervention materials in week 2 resulted in significant increases in fruit consumption across almost all subgroups. The other intervention materials used in the current study had rather limited effects in the short term. After 7 weeks of follow-up, significant fruit sale increases were established for all subgroups compared to baseline. At 30 weeks follow-up, the effect for staff B (Bachelor's degree) disappeared. The majority of the respondents (66.4%) had noticed at least one of the nudges, while only 3.4% indicated to have adjusted their dessert choice as a result of the nudges. Conclusions: The combination of nudges was effective in the long term and increased fruit purchase in nearly all subgroups.

This study integrates insights from environmental psychology and behavioral economics into choice models to assess which green nudges are most effective to increase consumer WTP for bio-based packaging. We tested a total of four strategies by providing consumers with nature pictures, reflection questions, information on bio-based plastics and normative information. Using a sample of 1019 German consumers, our results indicate that the strongest effects are generated when the nudging strategy matches the characteristic of consumers' cognitive style. For example, providing nature pictures only seems to increase WTP for bio-based packaging when consumers base their decision on their emotions and intuition.

J.","Background: Evidence on what strategiesâ€”or combination of strategiesâ€”are most effective and equitable in promoting healthier diets is needed. This study examined the efficacy of nudging and pricing strategies on increasing healthy food purchases and the potential differential effect by socio-economic position (SEP) among Dutch adults in a virtual supermarket. Methods: A randomized study design was conducted within a virtual supermarket (SN VirtuMart). Participants were exposed to five within-subject study conditions (control, nudging, pricing, price salience and price salience with nudging) and randomized to one of three between-subject study arms (a 25% price increase on unhealthy products, a 25% discount on healthy products, or a 25% price increase and discount). In total, 455 participants of low and high SEP (using either education or income as proxy) were randomized to conduct their weekly shopping in a virtual supermarket for five consecutive weeks. The primary outcome included the percentage of healthy purchases. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results: In total, 346 (76%) adults completed all five shops within the SN VirtuMart. Median age was 32.5, 49.2% had high education and 32.8% had high income. Out of the 12 conditions, four conditions were statistically significantly different from the control condition. Nudging and non-salient pricing strategies alone did not statistically significantly increase healthy food purchases, whereas a combination of salient price increases and discounts led to an increase in the percentage of healthy food purchases (B 4.5, 95%CI 2.6; 6.4). Combining salient pricing and nudging strategies led to increases in the percentage of healthy products in all three pricing arms, with largest effects found in the combined price increase and discount arm (B = 4.0, 95%CI = 2.0; 6.0). Effects were not modified by SEP. Conclusions: Combining health-related price increases and discounts and combining these salient pricing strategies with nudges in a supermarket setting seems to stimulate healthy food purchases for both low and high SEP populations. However, further research in real-world settings is needed.

To support users in adopting healthy exercise routines, app designers integrate persuasive techniques in their apps. In this study, we focus on two of these techniques, i.e., offering tangible rewards and sending motivational messages to users. Past research has demonstrated the effects of these techniques in nudging recipients to increase their physical activity levels. However, the effect of these interventions on the intrinsic motivation of the participants has not yet been studied. We conducted a 10-month study involving 208 participants; this research consisted of a 3-month baseline (pre-phase), a 4-month experiment and a 3-month follow-up (post-phase). The participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three interventions: either they receive money ((i.) through a fixed incentive or (ii.) a lottery), or (iii.) informative messages. Their daily goal was to walk 10K steps. Through their smart phones, we recorded how many steps they walked every day. These interventions had no effect on the main outcome variable (i.e., the number of steps). However, the manipulations produced a detrimental effect on the intrinsic motivation of the participants, measured through a standardized questionnaire. This negative effect extended into the follow-up period. Our study reveals that tangible rewards and motivational messages decrease the intrinsic motivation of the participants, hence their connected physical activity. In our findings, we highlight the importance of intrinsic motivation in setting up healthy exercise routines that will be carried on autonomously by the participants after the period of the intervention. Finally, we present implications for the design of persuasive apps.

In an incentiveâ€compatible experiment, 459 participants engaged in a task simulating their working life. Periodically during the simulation, participants chose between different investment options. The authors examined the effectiveness of a â€œnudgeâ€ by manipulating the default option and the effectiveness of a â€œsignpostâ€ by manipulating the display of a pictograph summarizing the expected return of each option. Participants often followed the default option, particularly when it was â€œsmartâ€ (i.e., became more conservative as retirement approached) and when presented together with dynamic pictographs (i.e., updated each year assuming the investment was held until retirement). Those most likely to make optimal choices (i.e., consistent with the life cycle model) were presented with a smart default or dynamic pictographs. These findings reveal how different choice architecture interventions can be used to positively influence behavior. Retirement funds and regulators can support retirement savings decisions by the provision of smart defaults and better risk information in the form of pictographs.

Behavioral nudges in the food environment increase healthy choices, but it is unknown if they improve diet and health. The ChooseWell 365 study will determine if an automated, personalized worksite intervention to nudge healthier choices improves overall diet and cardiometabolic health.
Design
Randomized controlled trial of 602 hospital employees who regularly use on-site cafeterias and pay with an employee ID.
Intervention
The intervention combines an environmental strategy (traffic-light labeling) with objective feedback and personalized nudges (health/lifestyle tips, social norms, incentives) to promote healthy food choices. The ChooseWell 365 software platform automatically generates personalized emails and letters that integrate employees' weight goals with health, lifestyle, and cafeteria purchasing data. Over one year, the intervention group receives two weekly emails. One provides a log of daily purchases; the second provides personalized health/lifestyle tips. The intervention group receives monthly mailed letters with social norm comparisons and financial incentives for healthier purchases. The one-year intervention will be completed in February 2019; all follow-up will be completed March 2020.
Outcomes
Weight, cardiometabolic risk factors, and dietary intake at one and two-year follow-up. Other outcomes include worksite food purchases by study participants and other non-participant employees who are socially connected (inferred from purchasing data) to participants.
Conclusions
ChooseWell 365 tests a novel strategy to deliver a scalable worksite prevention program that is integrated into the workday. The intervention is personalized but automated and therefore does not require costlier individual counseling. In the future, this program could be applied broadly in other worksite settings.",Contemporary Clinical Trials,2018,10.1016/j.cct.2018.11.004,ScienceDirect,,201,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/13vcjhokrxwbMcfoIgAqqyYeFfzlsyZzQ/view?usp=sharing,athorndike@mgh.harvard.edu,Y,,N,0,0,This is a protocol,N,-,,,,,#N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,Health,United States of America,,,-,,N,-,,,-,0,,,,,,,,-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,-

In Experiment 1 (conducted online; N = 122), we examined whether varying the orientation of the food on the plate (either vertically stacked or horizontally arrayed) would affect people's ratings of liking (of the visual arrangement), willingness-to-pay for the dish, artistic value (how artistic the dish looks), and perceived portion size. Experiment 2 (N = 124) extended this research to a naturalistic dining context, demonstrating the influence of both plating arrangement (horizontal vs. vertical) and centrality (centred vs. offset plating) on the same ratings. In both experiments, the plate of food was rated as constituting a larger portion when the elements were arrayed-horizontally rather than stacked vertically. Additionally, the centrally-plated dessert was rated as a larger portion than the offset version of exactly the same dish. The food was also liked more and the participants/diners were willing to pay more for it when horizontally and/or centrally arranged. These results provide important guidelines for enhancing the visual arrangement of a dish, in order to increase enjoyment, and possibly also nudge consumers toward better food choices.

We found that neutral labeling outperformed explicit labeling among all meat eaters (neutral 17%, meat 10%, explicit labels 5%â€“7%) and in two sub-groups, namely, non-reducers (who are not actively reducing their meat intake: explicit 3.4%, neutral 10.2%) and meat-reducers (explicit 14.4%, neutral 30.1%). We found no significant differences between the four explicit labels. We show that non-reducers with low meat-eating identity can be nudged to choose a neutrally labeled vegetarian dish, and that, among ethically concerned meat-reducers, the vegetarian dish is chosen more often when the dish is neutrally rather than explicitly labeled. Finally, we show that meat-avoiders (additional convenience sample, n = 148) were as likely to choose a neutrally labeled vegetarian dish as an explicitly labeled one. Our results suggest that neutral labeling sidesteps reactance and moral licensing effects in both meat-reducers and non-reducers, and that food outlets with meat-eating customers should carefully consider their use of explicit labeling and use neutral labeling for vegetarian dishes where possible.",Journal of Environmental Psychology,2022,10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101877,ScienceDirect,,222,Y,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HO5lSzfIp6cfs05GcJxt1mic2h-4pxDF/view?usp=sharing,marijke@food.ku.dk,Y,,Y,1,1,,Y,1,does changing dish labeling change vegetarian food choice,Y,Between-subjects only,"Parallel Design (A, B)",Code all,No,Y,,Y,Not ITT,No,Simple,Individuals,N,individuals,individuals,,Health,Denmark,,Y,6,N,N,N,"Material text is available in Table 2.

Although there is a growing amount of literature on formative argumentation feedback, empirical evidence on the effects of adaptive feedback mechanisms and novel NLP approaches to enhance argumentative writing remains scarce. To help fill this gap, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether automated feedback and social comparison nudging enable students to internalize and improve logical argumentation writing abilities in an undergraduate business course. We conducted a mixed-methods study to investigate the impact of argumentative writing on 71 students in a field experiment. Students in treatment group 1 completed their assignment while receiving automated feedback, whereas students in treatment group 2 completed the same assignment while receiving automated feedback with a social comparison nudge that indicated how other students performed on the same assignment. Students in the control group received generalized feedback based on rules of syntax. We found that participants who received automated argumentation feedback with a social comparison nudge wrote more convincing texts with higher-quality argumentation compared to the two benchmark groups (p &lt; 0.05). The measured self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and qualitative data provide valuable insights that help explain this effect. The results suggest that embedding automated feedback in combination with social comparison nudges enables students to increase their argumentative writing skills by triggering psychological processes. Receiving only automated feedback in the form of in-text argumentative highlighting without any further guidance appears not to significantly influence studentsâ€™ writing abilities when compared to syntactic feedback.

Background Regular attendance is often a challenge for couples participating in HMRE workshops. Studies suggest that nudges can increase attendance at appointments, but there has been little research on their application to family support programs. Method We conducted a Bayesian adaptive randomized controlled trial involving 1,742 couples in Florida. We assigned couples to either a control group that received no reminders or one of several treatment groups that received different types of reminders. We compared attendance across groups to estimate impacts of the messages on couples' initial and continued attendance. Results Simple reminders that provided only the date and time of the first session increased couples' initial session attendance by 12% compared with the control group. None of the reminders increased continued attendance among couples who attended the first session. Conclusion Simple reminders worked best for increasing initial attendance compared with messages with enhanced content, such as motivational messages, graphics, or peer testimonials. Couples that attended the first session had similarly high rates of continued session attendance regardless of the reminders. Implications Text message reminders show potential as a tool for boosting initial attendance at voluntary family support programs.

Background Regular attendance is often a challenge for couples participating in HMRE workshops. Studies suggest that nudges can increase attendance at appointments, but there has been little research on their application to family support programs. Method We conducted a Bayesian adaptive randomized controlled trial involving 1,742 couples in Florida. We assigned couples to either a control group that received no reminders or one of several treatment groups that received different types of reminders. We compared attendance across groups to estimate impacts of the messages on couples' initial and continued attendance. Results Simple reminders that provided only the date and time of the first session increased couples' initial session attendance by 12% compared with the control group. None of the reminders increased continued attendance among couples who attended the first session. Conclusion Simple reminders worked best for increasing initial attendance compared with messages with enhanced content, such as motivational messages, graphics, or peer testimonials. Couples that attended the first session had similarly high rates of continued session attendance regardless of the reminders. Implications Text message reminders show potential as a tool for boosting initial attendance at voluntary family support programs.

The social identity in our treatment is a refugeeâ€™s identification with the host society. We modified a mailing to 5600 refugees who use an online language-learning platform to learn the host countryâ€™s language. These treatment emails make salient that improving the host countryâ€™s language ability increases the belonging to the host society. Our analysis reveals that the treatment has a significant positive effect on the effort exerted on the language-learning platform, leading to more completed exercises and more time spent learning the host countryâ€™s language.

In a between-subjects field experiment, we randomly assign distinct cognitive and behavioral nudges focused on increasing vegetable consumption and decreasing food waste among foodservice consumers. The individual and joint efficacy of nudges in changing the intake and waste of each meal component is measured by scale. We find increases in both vegetable consumption (effect size = 0.90) and wasted food (effect size = 0.96) among participants randomly assigned to meals with 50 % (vs 25 %) of the plate covered with vegetables (behavioral nudge). Information about the social costs of food waste (cognitive nudge) mitigated the increase in waste induced by the 50 % vegetable nudge by encouraging greater vegetable intake. However, these mitigation effects disappeared if participants also received information (a second cognitive nudge) recommending increased vegetable consumption to improve health. Displaying meals on a larger plate (behavioral nudge) significantly increased selection of larger portion sizes, which led to greater vegetable intake but no change in waste.

In a largeâ€scale fieldâ€experiment, we applied four nudges to the digital menus in 136 hamburger restaurants. The nudges promoted vegetarian food purchases by either (1) changing the menu position of vegetarian food, or aligning vegetarian food with (2) a hedonic, tasteâ€focused nudge, (3) the warmâ€glow effect, or (4) a descriptive social norm. These nudges were thus aimed to shift salience toward a certain goal or the salience of a specific alternative. Vegetarian food purchases were measured in two datasets analyzing if nudges affected customers' â€œrouteâ€ to ordering vegetarian food (29,640 observations), and the total number of vegetarian food sold during the intervention (346,081 observations). Results showed that the position nudge affected customers route to buying vegetarian food. More specifically, making the â€œgreen categoryâ€ more accessible made more customers order through that category. Interestingly, this did not affect the total number of vegetarian sales.

Methods In a randomized study, conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific, we varied the manner in which the vaccination offer is posed. In one group, participants were asked to compare which vaccine they would like to take (i.e., the comparative probe), while, in another group, participants were asked to deliberate whether they would like to take the vaccine (i.e., the deliberative probe). Participantsâ€™ political preferences were also measured. The primary outcome variable was vaccine hesitancy. Results A LOGIT regression (N = 1736), was conducted to test the research questions. Overall, the comparative probe yielded a 6% reduction in vaccine hesitancy relative to the typical deliberative probe. Additionally, while vaccine hesitancy varies due to individual political views, the comparative probe is effective at reducing vaccine hesitancy even among the most vaccine hesitant population (i.e., Pro-Trump Republicans) by almost 10% on average. Conclusions Subtly changing the manner in which the vaccination offer is framed, by asking people to compare which vaccine to take, and not deliberate about whether they would like to take a vaccine, can reduce vaccine hesitancy, without being psychologically taxing or curtailing individualsâ€™ freedom to choose. The nudge is especially effective among highly vaccine hesitant populations such as Pro-Trump Republicans.

In two lab and two field studies, we created curiosity lures â€”incentives that pique peopleâ€™s curiosity and deliver its closure on the condition people choose the â€œshouldâ€ option over the â€œwantâ€ option. In all, our nudges were successful and highlight the external validity of our research. Notably, we observed a 9.8% increase in stairwell-use, and a 10% increase in fruit-and-vegetable purchases when we tested curiosity lures in large-scale field experiments totaling over 100,000 observations.
