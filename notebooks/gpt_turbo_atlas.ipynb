Despite their effectiveness in other domains, we find a tightly estimated zero for descriptive social norms on ridership. Increasing the economic incentive, by doubling the trial period, significantly increases uptake and long-term usage. This increase is sustained for months after removing the incentive. The effect is mainly driven by initial low users, which is evidence for habit formation and highlights the heterogeneous effects of the policy. While there is scope for long-term behavior change, norm nudges might not be the most promising approach.\\n\\n2021\\n\\nHabit formation Social norms\\n\\n## 1 Introduction\\n\\nDespite investments in infrastructure and technology, energy consumption in road transport grew by 117% between 1990 and 2017, posing a threat to our climate and health (European Environment Agency, 2018). Maintaining and increasing the public transport market share is on the national agenda of most industrialized nations, especially the European Union (European Commission, Environment Directorate-General, 2019). While investments in sustainable infrastructure make up a major share of the development plans, these investments need to be complemented with changes in individual travel behavior.\\n\\nKeeping infrastructure fixed, individual travel behavior can mainly be influenced through two channels - prices and behavioral interventions. Behavioral interventions, also known as nudges (Thaler and Sunstein, 2009), are seen as low cost,easily implementable, and less obtrusive compared to conventional steering instruments such as taxes and regulations (Benartzi et al., 2017; Carlsson et al., 2021). If they are effective at changing travel behavior while keeping prices constant, they would be a valuable addition to the policy toolkit, as suggested by Alta (2018), Metcalfe and Dolan (2012), Garcia-Sierra et al. (2015).\\n\\nThe most frequently evaluated type of nudge in the environmental domain is social proof (i.e. a descriptive social norm nudge) Carlsson et al., 2021. This type of norm-nudge has the intent of inducing desirable behavior by affecting expectations about what\\'most people\\' in the same situation do (Bicchieri and Dimant, 2019). The majority of these social norm studies focus on energy and water consumption. To the best of our knowledge there is no adequately powered randomized controlled study on social norms of public transport usage. This paper aims to fill this gap by testing whether social proof can have a positive effect on public transport usage compared to traditional price instruments and whether behavior change persists after nudges and incentives have been removed.\\n\\nTogether with a local transport agency in Southern Sweden, we conducted a natural field experiment with over 14,000 individuals. The experiment is implemented as part of a public transport marketing campaign. If a person moves to or within the region of Skane, Sweden, they, shortly after registering their new address, receive an offer to try the regional public transport for two weeks for free. If they do not respond, they receive one follow up reminder. If they do respond, they are sent a pre-paid, reusable travel card.\\n\\nWe compare the baseline of receiving an offer for a two-week free travel card to 1) an offer with a nudge in the form of a descriptive social norm message honestly stating that \"72% of their neighbors are traveling with public transport occasionally\" in addition to the two-week free travel card and 2) an offer of a four-week free travel card, thus doubling the economic incentive, by doubling the free travel time. We then tracked the initial response to the offer, the activation of the card, and usage of the card over the following eight months. We supplement the behavioral data with a short follow up survey. We directly compare the social norm nudge to a traditional economic incentive, thus testing the two major channels, prices and behavioral interventions, against each other. This comparison is important for two reasons. First, it allows us to understand whether a nudge is the most cost-effective intervention. Even if the price instrument would have the larger effect in behavior, the effect might be too small given the costs. A nudge, which in our setting would be costless to implement compared to the price instrument, could have a more favorable cost-benefit ratio. Second, in case the nudge is not successful, while the price instrument is, we can infer that individuals are generally able and willing to change their behavior and that the nudge was not strong enough to stimulate a change in behavior.\\n\\nOur randomized and large-scale design overcomes some of the issues of the previous studies in this area. Participants in our experiment are not aware that they are part of an experiment, and we use administrative data instead of self-reported data, which reduces potential biases or imperfect recall associated with self-reports (Fuiji and Kitamura, 2003; Thagersen, 2009; Bamberg and Rees, 2017). Especially, in the case of social norms it is to be expected that respondents would feel encouraged to report behavior in line with the communicated social norm. This would give us an artificial treatment effect. Another benefit of our approach is the length of our study period. Compared other studies who track trips from a day to a month, we can track every trip taken with the cards for up to eight months after the experiment and thus, estimate longer-term effects of our interventions at a daily level.\\n\\nWe find no evidence that our descriptive social norm nudge increased response rates to the free public transport offer. This result could be due to two reasons. Either, individuals were not interested in changing their travel habits, or the nudge was not effective. The evidence points to the latter. We find that the economic incentive, doubling the free travel time, increased responses to the offer by 16%, from a baseline of 42.8%. The interest in the four-week offer was thus significantly higher than in the two-week offer. This finding suggests that there are individuals that are interested in using public transport more often, given the right incentives.\\n\\nOur next result focuses on the activation of the card. It could be that while the four-week offer increases initial interest, this interest does not carry through to actual usage. This is not the case. Unconditionally on the initial response, we find a significantly higher amount of individuals activating a card in the four-week group than in the two-week control group and social norm group.\\n\\nEight months later, the cards from the four-week treatment group are significantly more likely (ca. 33% more) to still be in our sample of active cards. We measure the effect after the summer holidays in which individuals\\' travel habits might change due to vacation and a special summer offer on public transport. While the level effect of the active cards is low - only 11% of the individuals who opted into receiving the card are still using it eight months later - the treatment effect is significant. Extending the trial period by two weeks thus significantly increases long-term behavior change.\\n\\nOne might be concerned that our findings are not due to a causal effect on behavior change, but reflect initial differences between individuals who self-select into a four-week travel card and those who self-select into a two-week travel card. Using administrative travel data and survey data, we provide evidence in line with actual behavior change. We classify individuals into low and high users based on their initial travel behavior in week one. Individuals, who from day one of the trial period use the card at least two times per day, are classified as high users and most likely seem to have an established habit. Individuals who use the card less than two times per day during the first week are classified as low users. These are the individuals we are interested in, as they have the potential to increase their usage. The low users in the four-week treatment increase their usage during the trial period and are significantly more likely to use the card after the experimental period is over than low users in the two-week baseline. Further, after the trial period, we conducted a survey among card users and show that individuals randomized into the four-week treatment are more likely to say that they will travel \"more\" or \"much more\" by public transport after the free trial period compared to before than respondents from either of the two week groups. Taken together, the change in travel behavior and the survey responses provide evidence for behavior change and habit formation after the economic incentives are removed. The increased usage after the experimental period also increased the revenue of the transport agency, as individuals in the four-weeks group were more likely to buy monthly travel cards.\\n\\nThis paper contributes to our understanding of the effectiveness of behavioral interventions compared to price instruments in changing behavior. Environmental policy has seen a surge in studies on behavioral interventions that have shown to reduce household energy consumption (Allcott, 2011), household water consumption (Herrao et al., 2011; Tiefenbeck et al., 2016), meat consumption (Gravert and Kurz, 2019; Kurz, 2018), and food waste (Kallbekken and Selen, 2013). While a large literature has found significant effects of nudges on behavior in the environmental domain (see Carlsson et al., 2021 for a summary), there is little evidence on the effect of nudges on public transport. Comparing domains in which nudges have been successful, such as energy and water use and food consumption, one explanation for the lack of success in the transport domain is that switching between transport options comes at a higher effort and even monetary cost than switching between a meat and vegetarian dish at lunch or reducing shower time by a couple of minutes. Findings from one domain cannot easily be transferred to another, which is why nudges should be tested in different domains. There is also a lack of studies comparing price instruments to nudges for the same outcome measures. An exception is (Ito, 2015) who find that economic incentives have a longer-term effect on reducing energy consumption than a moral appeal. Our findings are in line with a recent paper by Kristal and Whillans (2019), who also tested several nudges on transportation usage. Like us, they find no effect of nudges such as letters or a customized travel plan on carpooling or bus travel. Their context is different in several dimensions. First, they are nudging employees of one airport, who all travel to the same workplace, while we are sampling from 1.4 million individuals of the Swedish population, who live and work (or don\\'t work) in various places across the region. Second, they mostly focus on carpooling while we focus on public transport. Third, they only have short-term outcomes, while we can observe travel behavior for eight months. Since we make use of an existing campaign, we keep the experimental setup as natural as possible, which increases external validity.2\\n\\nFootnote 2: Very similar campaigns to ours have been run in both Gothenburg and Stockholm, Sweden, but not scientifically evaluated.\\n\\nFurther, our study contributes to the formation and persistence of habits. The economic literature provides several examples of prolonged behavior change or habit formation after providing economic incentives in the health domain (Finkelstein et al., 2007; Charness and Gneezy, 2009; Volpp et al., 2009a; 2009b; John et al., 2011; Cawley and Price, 2013; Just and Price, 2013; Alcland and Levy, 2015; Royer et al., 2015) and the savings domain (see for example Schaner (2018)). However, in many cases, the effects are short-lived and usually reversed by vacation or holidays unless they come with additional interventions (Gneezy et al., 2011; John et al., 2011; Royer et al., 2015). In our study, we find a significant persistence of travel habits even after a two months summer break.\\n\\nWhat do our results imply for policymakers trying to increase public transport usage through behavioral interventions or price instruments? The social norm nudge we chose to test has been shown to be effective in other environmental policy settings such as energy consumption, water consumption and food waste. In this case, we find no effect of the nudge on behavior, while we do find a change in behavior when the incentives increase. Our findings support the arguments by Bicchieri and Dimant (2019) that norm-nudges require a detailed and nuanced understanding of the beliefs and circumstances of the individuals being nudged in order to be successful. This would require detailed knowledge about the population and most likely personalized nudges. If this is not possible, as in our setting, a population-wide transport intervention, an economic incentive seems to be the more promising and cost-effective approach that can lead to long-term behavior change for a significant sample of the population.\\n\\n## 2 Experimental design\\n\\nThe experiment was designed and conducted in cooperation with Skanetrafiken, the administration for public transportation in the county Skane in southernmost Sweden. Skane has approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and contains urban areas such as Malmo (with 300,000 inhabitants) as well as rural villages. The public transportation managed by Skanetrafiken is used by 250,000 people daily. It consists of buses, trans and regional trains. To travel by public transport, individuals needed, at the time of the experiment, an electronic Jolo card (a plastic card that looks like a credit card), which can be either uploaded with a pre-paid amount so that for each trip, the payment is deducted, or it can be uploaded with a monthly card for an unlimited amount of trips per month. Every user needs one card which can be re-used until lost or stolen. A single trip could cost between 35 Swedish Kroner (SEK) within a city to 122 SEK (USD 3.68 / USD 12.84) between cities 1,5 h apart. Travelers need to scan the card every time they use a bus, tram, or train by holding it against a card reader.3 Even when they have a monthly pass, they need to register their trip. This feature allows us to track trips both during and after the trial period for both the monthly card users and pre-paid users.4The intervention was designed and sent out as part of a flyer campaign by Skanetrafiken, targeted at people who moved to or within the region. During the time frame of the campaign, shortly after moving to a new address, all individuals in the area receive a flyer from Skanetrafiken. The timing is chosen deliberately to give the interventions the highest chances of success. An ideal time to get people to change their travel habits is when they switch residences, as that \"unfreezes\" the usual habit of traveling the same route to work and other activities (Verplanken et al., 2008). As Goodwin (1977) has argued \"the traveler does not carefully and deliberately calculate anew each morning whether to go to work by car or bus. Such deliberation is likely to occur only occasionally, probably in response to some large change in the situation.\"\\n\\nFootnote 3: The time of the experiment is 19% of the population had a monthly card. Based on statistics from the region (Skändol, 2018) on a 10% of the individuals in our experiment are new inhabitants of the region and therefore will certainly not have a monthly card, so the share of jolo card owners in our sample should be slightly below the region average.\\n\\nThe basic flyer, which we will use as our baseline, contained the name of the resident, their closest public transport stop, information about Skanetrafiken, and the offer of a free two-week trial (see the Online Appendix for all communication material in Swedish and an English translation). The market value of the free travel card was 625 Swedish Kronor (ca. USD 65). The trial card covered unlimited trips within the region. The card, which is identical to the ones that could be bought, could be used for the duration of the free travel time and could then be uploaded with either a monthly pass, that had to be renewed every month, or with a balance to be used for individual trips. If a receiver was interested in the offer, they then had two weeks to go online to order the card. The trial period started four weeks after the send out date. This allows even those individuals who had just bought a monthly card to make use of the offer. Initial interest was recorded by receivers logging into the transport agency\\'s webpage with a code from the flyer. Since the code was personal, we can track which treatment group the individual had been assigned to. While technically feasible, but for privacy reasons not legal, we do not collect any information on the demographics or precise location of the individual. We thus only track cards, not individuals. We also do not know, if they previously had a transport card.5\\n\\nFootnote 5: At the time of the experiment a 19% of the population had a monthly card. Based on statistics from the region (Skändol, 2018) on a 10% of the individuals in our experiment are new inhabitants of the region and therefore will certainly not have a monthly card, so the share of jolo card owners in our sample should be slightly below the region average.\\n\\nIf no reply to the offer was received, an informationally identical reminder was mailed out two weeks later. The reminder had the same code as the first flyer, so we can track whether the card was claimed online. If a reply was received, the resident received their free public transport card, the jolo card, together with another letter. The letter that came with the card explained that the card could be used in the region of Skaine and on all buses, trans and regional trains. As the mailings were considered \"business-as-usual\" the participants were not informed that they were taking part in an experiment.\\n\\nThe data provides us with four types of outcome variables (see Fig. 1 for an overview). First, we measure whether a card was ordered in response to the offer (or in response to the reminder). Second, we measured how many cards were activated. And third, we track the number of cards used and trips taken over an eight months period. The free trial period ended after two weeks (four weeks for one group), so the cards needed to be recharged by the participants themselves to be used at a later point. Fourth, we collect data on whether the cards have been uploaded with allowance for individual trips or with a monthly card.\\n\\nOur data provides us with information on each card ID and how often it was used per day. We have no information on where users went with the card. We also cannot match the cards to individual people and their demographics for privacy reasons.\\n\\nWe collected the names and addresses of everyone between the ages of 19 and 65 who moved to or within Skane in the period between 12th of December 2017 and 16th of January 2018, which resulted in a sample of \\\\(N=14282\\\\). These individuals received a randomized version of the first flyer on the 26th of February 2018.\\n\\n### Treatments\\n\\nWe test whether the addition of a social norm has an effect on the response to the offer of the free two-week Jolo card. Social norms can be injunctive (i.e., describing a socially accepted behavior) or descriptive (i.e. a norm that describes a prevalent behavior) (Caldini, 2003; Schultz et al., 2007). In their overview article Garcia-Sierra et al. (2015) propose the use of descriptive norms as a way to strengthen informational messages in promoting public transport. They argue that\\n\\nFigure 1: Steps of the campaign and outcome variables.\\n\\nmost pro-environmental behavior is driven by the desire to fit in with a social norm and that public transport usage can be modeled as a social dilemma. Driving a car might be optimal for the individual, but bad for society. Highlighting the social norm of public transport usage could affect beliefs about conditional cooperators and free-riding could be considered as a violation of the norm. Thus, if the majority uses public transport, this norm should be emphasized to discourage free-riding. Social norms have been proven effective in several other studies in the environmental domain. In one of the most prominent studies, Allcott (2011) evaluates a field experiment with a large US energy provider. Customers were shown their own energy consumption in comparison to their closest, most efficient neighbors. The intervention significantly reduced energy use. Similarly, letting people know that other hotel guests reuse their towels led to an increase in towel reuse (Galdini, 2003). In an overview article on green nudges, Carlsson et al., 2021 present 17 field studies on the successful use of injunctive or descriptive social norms in promoting environmentally friendly behavior. Fourteen of these studies are on reducing water or electricity consumption. Further, there is evidence of using social norms to encourage other socially desirable behavior such as paying taxes (Hallsworth et al., 2017) or giving to charity (Agerstrom et al., 2016). However, Donald et al. (2014) caution that descriptive norms might give an impression of public transport being overly congested and so discourage people from using it.\\n\\nSince social proof needs to be honest, we used survey data from Skinetrafik to calculate the share of individuals who travel by public transport. The descriptive social norm message we used was: \"Did you know that most people in Skane travel with us? 72% of us living in Skane travel by public transport occasionally. So join your neighbors and try it out\". To calculate 72% we aggregated the numbers of all individuals who travel at least several times per month to those who travel daily by public transport.\\n\\nWe test the descriptive social norm condition against a price instrument. We double the trial period to four weeks for the treatment group. The value of the four-week card is 1250 SEK (ca. USD 130). Basic price theory tells us that this should make the offer more attractive. More importantly, though, being incentivized to try public transport out for longer, provides a higher chance for long-term behavior change. Given that public transport in Sweden is already quite popular, at least occasionally (as we see from the descriptive social norm), we can assume that close to all individuals have previously experienced public transport. Thus, the campaign was targeted towards building a habit of using public transport more frequently, rather than introducing individuals to public transportation as such.6 So while the higher value might attract more individuals, the longer time frame was an important aspect of this treatment.\\n\\nFootnote 6: A 2018 large scale survey among Skane residents showed only 20% of all travel was conducted by public transport. Over 50% of individuals report taking the car to work. Thus, there is room for our participants to shift their behavior towards using public transport more (Heldlund, 2018).\\n\\nWe simply randomized our sample into three groups. The control group received the usual flyer with the offer to receive a free two-week travel card (\\\\(N=4764\\\\)). The descriptive social norms group receives the same two-week free travel card and the positive social norms message (\\\\(N=4758\\\\)). The four-week group receives the offer of a four-week free travel card without the social norm message (\\\\(N=4760\\\\)).\\n\\nIf individuals responded to the offer by ordering the card online, they received the standard letter with their card a couple of days later. If they did not reply, they received a reminder two weeks later. Otherwise, they received no further communication.7\\n\\nFootnote 7: We conducted two more experiments on independent samples in which we tested a positive and a negative framing of the descriptive social norm message in the reminder and the use of implementation intentions in the letter accompanying the card. Despite being well-powered to detect an effect both interventions show tightly estimated zeros. The design and the results of these supplementary experiments can be found in the Online Appendix.\\n\\n## 3 Results\\n\\nIn this paper, we ask two primary questions. First, are descriptive social norm nudges, compared to traditional price instruments, effective in changing the uptake and usage of public transport? Second, does increasing the trial period - from two to four weeks - lead to long-term habit formation?\\n\\nOur three binary outcome measures are the initial response to the offer (entering the personal code online), the activation of the card during the trial period and the reactivation after the summer vacation, six months later. The two latter binary measures are equal to one if the card was held against a card reader in a bus, tram or train at least once during the trial period and after August 15th 2018, respectively. Because we are tracking cards, not individuals, there are no control variables to report.\\n\\nOverall, we find that the average response rate to the offer is 44.6%. 84% of the cards that were claimed were also activated. That corresponds to an overall activation rate of around 38%. In the long-run 11% of the claimed cards were still in use (ca. 4% of the total offer).\\n\\nWe find that initial response to the free trial was higher in the four-week group (49.6%, \\\\(n=2359\\\\)) than in both the standard group (42.8%, \\\\(n=2038\\\\)) and the social norm group (41.6%, \\\\(n=1977\\\\)), (see Fig. 2). A Chi2 test confirms that cards in the four-week version were significantly more likely to be claimed than in the standard group (Chi2 (1) = 44.03, \\\\(p<0.001\\\\)). This means participants in the four-week group were 15.89% more likely to respond to the offer. Cards in the social norm group were no more likely to be claimed than those in the standard group (Chi2 (1) = 1.47, \\\\(p=0.225\\\\)).\\n\\nA larger percentage of cards was activated in the four-week group (44.12%, \\\\(n=2100\\\\)) than in the standard group (34.45%, \\\\(n=1641\\\\)) and the social norm group (34.09%, \\\\(n=1622\\\\)). The difference between the activation rates is significantly different between the four-week group and the standard group, but not for the social norms group (Chi2 (1) = 93.38, \\\\(p<0.001\\\\) and Chi2 (1) = 0.13, \\\\(p=0.714\\\\), respectively).\\n\\nAfter summer, we observe significantly more active cards in the sample of the initial four week offer (5.63%, \\\\(n=268\\\\)) than for the cards with the standard offer (3.76%, \\\\(n=179\\\\)) or the social norms offer (3.91%, \\\\(n=186\\\\)) (Chi2 (1) = 18.67,\\\\(p<0.001\\\\) and Chi2 (1) = 0.15, \\\\(p=0.700\\\\), respectively). At this time, users had to upload money on their cards to continue using them.8\\n\\nFootnote 8: We confirm the intent-to treat results in a Probit regression in the Appendix Table A1.\\n\\nComparing the levels of the initial interest and the first activation with the usage after summer for all three groups, we can already conclude that the offer is popular and most individuals who claim the card also follow through with using the card at least once during the trial period. However, in the long-run, when users need to pay themselves for trips, only around 11% of the initially claimed cards are still in use.9 Clearly, there is a meaningful difference in behavior when travel is free and when it needs to be paid for.\\n\\nFootnote 9: Conditional on activation, the numbers are 12.76% for the four weeks offer, 10.91% for the control group and 11.47% for the social norms group (Chi2 (1) = 3.01, \\\\(p=0.08\\\\) and Chi2 (1) = 0.26, \\\\(p=0.61\\\\), respectively).\\n\\nWe can thus conclude this section with an answer to our first question. Our descriptive social norm nudge was not effective in changing travel behavior compared to the baseline offer. Increasing the economic incentives and prolonging the trial period, on the other hand, was.\\n\\n### Travel behavior\\n\\nNow that we have seen that receivers of the four-week trial offer were significantly more likely to reply to the offer and activate their card, we are interested in whether the treatments had an effect on travel behavior.\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the aggregate number of trips taken over the eight months period (26th of March to 29th of October). The black line shows the two-week group and the red line the norms group, who are almost indistinguishable from each\\n\\nFigure 3: Trips per day by treatment group.\\n\\nFigure 2: Number of responses, activated cards and cards used after summer in absolute numbers.\\n\\nother. The blue line tracks the aggregate number of trips taken in the four-week group. The pattern shows a higher number of trips from Monday-Friday - consistent with a commuting pattern. This gives us confidence that the card is not only used for trips \"on top\" of necessary trips but is replacing other means of transport.10 We also see a sharp drop for all three groups when the free trial period ends. Further, there are close to no trips during the summer months and then the trips pick up again after August 15th. The drop off around 15th of June is not as clear cut, as some people might have monthly cards that they use until they expire and then buy a summer card. For all measured time periods, the four-week group takes more trips per day than the baseline and the social norms group. We will rule out that this is mainly due to self-selection in Section 3.2.\\n\\nFootnote 10: We acknowledge, that we do not know which means of transport are being replaced - more on this in the discussion.\\n\\nIn Table 1, we present OLS regressions on the number of trips taken during different time periods to estimate the effect size of the differences and test for significance. The first column reports the effect for the first two weeks of the experiment. We use two weeks, so we can compare the number of trips taken during the experiment for the two two-week groups and the four-week group. We find that individuals assigned to receive the four-week card take 1.7 more trips during the first two weeks of the experiment than those in the baseline group. This effect is significant on the 1 percent level. There is no difference between the baseline and the social norms group. We see from the constant that in the baseline group the card is used for 5.9 trips during the two-week period. During the total experimental period the cards in the four-week treatment were used for 9.8 trips more than in the baseline (column 2). Given that these individuals had twice the time to use the card, it is not surprising that this is significantly more. The same mechanical increase is true for our regression in column 3 which shows the effect of the four-week treatment on the total number of trips (\\\\(\\\\beta=14.6\\\\)). However, excluding the experimental period to make the treatments comparable shows that cards in the four-week condition were used for on average 4.9 trips more than the cards in the two-week condition. Thus, the four-week treatment almost doubles the number of trips taken after the experiment is over (10.3 trips vs. 5.4 trips). None of the estimates for the social norms treatment are significant.\\n\\nOn average, individuals in the four-week treatment took 25.9 trips during the eight month period. This might seem low. It is important to remember, that these are unconditional results (Intent-to-Treat effect) to report unbiased estimates. More than 50% of the cards have not been claimed and thus have not been used for any trips. In Appendix Table 1 we condition on the card being activated and find that on average, each activated card was used around 17 times during the first two weeks of the experiment. There are no significant treatment differences in usage within the first two weeks. Over the course of the experimental period the activated four-weeks cards were used more than twice as often as the activated two-week cards (35 times vs. 17 times). Excluding the experimental period (column 4) shows that the cards in the four-weeks treatment, conditional on having been used at least once, were used on average for 7.6 more trips than the standard treatment cards (23 times vs. 16 times). This is a significant 50 percent increase.11\\n\\nFootnote 11: We include these conditional results to give a more realistic picture of the additional trips taken for those who took up the offer, but acknowledge that due to the endogeneity in the first stage, we cannot be certain that the results are completely unbiased.\\n\\nThere is quite a sharp drop in usage after the offer ends. We can only speculate on the reasons. The most straight forward explanation is that for many individuals who own a car, free public transport is more cost-effective, but once they are asked to pay themselves, they go back to using their car. Other individuals (around 19%) might already have a Jolo card and go back to using their old one. Skanetrafik also offers an app with which one can pay for trips. Some individuals might decide to use the app instead. We cannot track transition from card to app. However, given that we have randomized the sample,\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\\\hline \\\\hline  & First 2 weeks & Experiment & Total & Total excl.

In the next section, we will provide evidence that the intervention changed travel behavior long-term for at least part of our sample.\\n\\n### Evidence of habit formation\\n\\nThe second question we are interested in answering is whether extending the trial period to one month, has a significant effect on long-term behavior change, i.e. habit formation. Habits are formed by repeatedly engaging in a behavior, with a more consistent performance of behavior leading to a habit being formed quicker (Lally et al., 2010). A longer incentivized time period increases the number of times a behavior can and will be performed, which leads to a higher chance of that behavior becoming a habit. Consistent with the existing economics literature, we refer to \"persistence of a behavior change after the incentives are removed\" as \"habit formation\" effects (Volpp and Loewenstein, 2020).12\\n\\nFootnote 12: We recognize that this definition is not in line with the definition of habits usually used in psychology in which a habit is an automatic behavior without conscious decision to do so (Volpp and Loewenstein, 2020). We also do not make any assumptions about the behavioral channel for the habit formation. Long-run effects in our experiment could be due to different types of learning such as learning about their own states or information acquisition about the convenience of taking public transport or a consequence of selling their car and thus being forced to use public transport or other lifestyle changes.\\n\\nSome of the users of the free card might already be taking public transport regularly and thus have no more room to increase their usage even further. We are interested in the group of individuals who still has room to change their behavior, i.e. increase their usage of the card over a longer period of time. As with most field experiments, we only observe the travel behavior of the individuals who chose to respond to the offer of the free travel card. Naturally, one might be concerned about self-selection based on unobservables. Even though both the two-week and the four-week treatment provide a significant incentive, especially to those individuals who already plan on commuting, we cannot rule out that the two offers attracted different types of individuals. As explained in Section 2, the campaign was timed to make both cards attractive regardless of already purchased cards, by creating a time gap between the offer and the start of the trial period. That meant that even if someone had just bought a four-week card they were informed of the two-week offer early enough and could plan to use the free card for two weeks, when their current monthly card expired and before buying another monthly card. Monthly cards are not restricted to calendar days, but are valid for 30 days from day of purchase. Nevertheless, the unconditional higher trip rate in the first two weeks of the experiment for the four-week group points towards the groups not being completely equal.\\n\\nInvestigating the travel patterns of the individuals who have opted in to each treatment can give us insight into whether behavior changed during the experiment and whether this behavior is sustained after the incentive is removed, thus providing suggestive evidence for new travel habits for at least some of the participants.\\n\\nWe split the data into activated cards that follow a commuting pattern of ten trips or more during the working days of the first week. Ten trips correspond to two trips per day - to and from work during workdays.13 We call these observations \"high users\" (\\\\(N=1899\\\\)). They hit the ground running from day one and might either be particularly motivated to change their habits or have already established commuting habits prior to the campaign.14 Since these users are already at a reasonable maximum of public transport usage, we cannot measure whether they are developing a new habit or not. A Chi2-test does not show any significant difference in \"high users\" active in the four-week or the two-week group (Chi2(1) = 0.863, \\\\(p=0.353\\\\)).\\n\\nFootnote 13: A representative survey from Hedlund (2018) showed that on average inhabitants of Skane make two trips per day.\\n\\nFootnote 14: The share of “high users” compared to the full sample is ca. 14K. We know from Hedlund (2018) that ca. 19K of inhabitants of Skane own a monthly public transport card. This share might be lower for those who moved within the past month. However, it is likely, that these “high users” already had a public transport card when the offer came.\\n\\nThe interesting group for potential habit formation are the individuals who conduct fewer trips during the first week. Those users who use the card for fewer than 10 trips in the first week are classified as \"low users\" (\\\\(N=3463\\\\)). These individuals make up 65% of the group of individuals who have activated their card. They have the potential to increase their usage over time and do not show initial behavior that is in line with commuting and thus an existing habit.\\n\\nAs we show in Fig. 4, looking only at the high and low users of the four-week card, the \"high users\" by definition start high and continue high for the duration of the experiment and after (purple line). The \"low users\" (green line) increase their usage over the first three weeks of the experiment and level out during the last week and for the next eight months. We see the leveling out at a higher level then at the start as evidence that for these \"low users\" habit formation takes place and that a longer trial period leads to stronger habit formation. For example, the average number of trips in the first week of a low user in the two-week treatment is 3.6, while it is 3.2 in the four-week group. However, in the week after the experiment, the average number of trips per card of those classified as low users in the two-week group drops to 0.27, while it is still 1.3 for the four-week group. As they both started out with a similar number of trips (the four-week group even a bit lower), the post-experimental difference is unlikely to stem from initial differences in the users.\\n\\nIn Table 2, we show our results from an OLS regression with robust standard errors in which we regress the total number of trips taken during eight month, excluding the experimental period, on the treatments, the dummy of whether a card was used by a high user during the first week, and interaction effects of the treatments and the high user dummy. We cannot include the experimental period since the four-week group had more time to take free trips. From the perspective of habit formation, we are also more interested in effects after the incentivized period is over. We only include observations that have at least taken one trip during the experimental period.\\n\\nWe find a significant effect of the four-week treatment for the low users (\\\\(\\\\beta=6.383\\\\)). This means that in the eight months following the experiment, low users from the treatment group use the card, on average, 6.4 trips more than low users from the baseline group. This effect is significant on the 1 percent level. Unsurprisingly, those individuals we classified as high users also use the card more after the experiment is over. These cards are used for an average of 22 trips more than the cards of the low users. This is also significant on the 1 percent level.15 There are no significant interaction effects of the high users and the treatments.16 Again, there is no significant effect on the social norms treatment. While these effects might seem small given the time frame, one must remember that there is a large share of zeros in the data, as many cards were not used after the experimental period. These effects are identified from ca. 31.7 percent of the initial responses.\\n\\nFootnote 15: As a robustness check, we repeat the analysis with 20 trips the first two weeks and find comparable, significant estimates. Results available by request.\\n\\nFootnote 16: When turning the outcome variable into its log form, as suggested by one of the referees, the interaction effect between high users and the four-week treatment is positive and significant at the 5-percent level. The estimate is smaller (0.29) than the estimate for the low users (0.38), which stays significant at the 1-percent level. Details available upon request.\\n\\nThe results in this section show that there is significant heterogeneity in the possibility of habit formation. Roughly a third of individuals who respond to the offer behave in a way that is in line with existing habits. However, 65% of the users start from a low usage during the first week and increase over the four-week period. These individuals, who were randomized into either two or four-week cards seem to be positively affected by the additional two weeks, driving the\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l c} \\\\hline \\\\hline  & Total excl.

The pattern we observe is thus in line with habit formation for this subset of individuals.17\\n\\nFootnote 17: One might be concerned with a regression to the mean effect based on the initial classification of high and low users. We see that those individuals, who were initially classified as high users, stay above the ones classified as low users for all observation periods, but cannot completely rule out that there is some mean reversion in effect.\\n\\n### Conditional usage and economic viability of the campaign\\n\\nAfter the experimental period was over, the cards could be topped-up with either a balance that could be used for individual trips or with a monthly travel card. Table 3, columns 1 and 2, shows the amount of monthly cards bought for the sample of activated cards in the main experiment (\\\\(n=5363\\\\)). Cards in the four-week treatment were significantly more often uploaded with a monthly card (\\\\(p<0.001\\\\)). On average, these cards were uploaded with 0.23 more monthly cards. Further, high users uploaded their card with 0.24 more monthly cards. This estimate is also significant. The estimate of the four-week treatment is not affected by controlling for high users. This lack of variation is additional evidence that the effect is not only driven by a different share of high users, but by the treatment.\\n\\nColumns 3 and 4 show the total amount of money uploaded onto each card in the eight months period after the experiment. This can be in the form of monthly cards or pre-paid allowance. Cards in the four-week group were uploaded with on average 522 SEK, that is 201 SEK more than cards in the two-week group. Those classified as high users spend 145 SEK more.\\n\\nThe cost of additional riders during the campaign period to the public transport agency is negligible. There were no additional direct costs. A quick back of the envelope calculation concludes that had everyone in the sample received the four-week card the transport agency would have made 107,000 SEK (10,900 USD) more. To calculate this we assume that also the two two-week groups would have 268 individuals active after summer and each of them would have spent 201 SEK more.\\n\\nTaken together, these results present strong evidence in favor of long-term behavior change for a significant sub-group of the individuals in the four-week treatment.\\n\\n## 4 Discussion\\n\\nWe showed in the previous section that individuals randomly allocated to the four-week treatment were significantly more likely to take public transport even months later. This effect is mostly driven by the initial low users, who increase their usage over time and sustain higher usage after the incentive is removed. To further convince the reader that this is not an artifact of self-selection, we conducted an online survey after the experimental period (April 2018). We received 257 answers. Out of the individuals who had received a two-week travel card (either with the social norm or without) ca. 60% responded that they had used the card 10 times or more during the trial period compared to the 85% in the four-week group, who gave this answer (see Fig. 11). This fits well with our administrative data and is unsurprising, since the participant in the four-week group had more time to use it. More interesting is the difference in their self-reported, intended travel behavior after the free period ended. In the two-week groups 12% responded that they will travel \"much more\" and 28% \"a bit more\" with public transport after the trial than before the trial period. For the four-week group these numbers are markedly higher. 20% plan to travel much more and 34% a bit more (see Fig. 12). Our behavioral data showed that conditional on being activated, cards in the four-week group were used ca. 50% more than in the two-week groups - well in line with the self-reported intentions from the survey.\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\\\hline  & Monthly Card & Monthly Card & Total SEK & Total SEK \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline Four Weeks & 0.230\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) & 0.234\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) & 201.417\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) & 203.536\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) \\\\\\\\  & (0.035) & (0.034) & (34.960) & (34.857) \\\\\\\\ Social Norms & 0.016 & 0.014 & 3.500 & 1.908 \\\\\\\\  & (0.031) & (0.031) & (31.631) & (31.593) \\\\\\\\ High User & & 0.240\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) & & 145.273\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) \\\\\\\\  & & (0.033) & & (30.733) \\\\\\\\ Constant & 0.250\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) & 0.165\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) & 321.358\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) & 269.570\\\\({}^{\\\\text{--}}\\\\) \\\\\\\\  & (0.021) & (0.022) & (22.479) & (23.341) \\\\\\\\ \\\\(N\\\\) & 5363 & 5363 & 5363 & 5363 \\\\\\\\ \\\\(R^{2}\\\\) & 0.011 & 0.022 & 0.009 & 0.013 \\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{tabular} Each column reports coefficients from separate OLS regressions.

While we cannot rule out that recipients overlooked the message on the flyer, we argue that the generally very high opt-in rates of over 40% in all treatments suggest that this was an attractive offer. Further, recipients needed to read the instructions to understand how to claim their card. Considering that the descriptive norm of \"72% of people living in Skane occasionally use public transport\" was the truth and thus, the only message we would be able to print, we did not see the need to elicit beliefs prior to the experiment. However, ex-post we surveyed 306 inhabitants of Skane about their beliefs as part of a representative online survey.18 We asked: \"What do you think is the share of the population in Skane who occasionally use public transport?\", thus staying as close as possible to formulation used in the experiment. On average, the belief was 31.13% (\\\\(n=237\\\\)). This average belief is far below the descriptive norm. As Fig. A3 in the Appendix shows, there are very few guesses above 72%. The majority believed that less than 50% of their neighbors travel by public transport. Individuals who live in one of the 10 largest cities have slightly higher beliefs than those who live in more rural areas (32.64% vs. 29.70%).19 We further asked the respondents whether they would change their travel behavior if they were informed that 72% of their new neighbors would occasionally take public transport. As visible in Fig. A4 in the Appendix, the vast majority (81%) said, this would not affect their travel habits. 16% said they would travel more and only 3% said they would travel less. Hence, it is unlikely that the high norm discouraged individuals from taking public transport by suggesting that it is too crowded (as had been hypothesized by Donald et al. (2014)). The result that 16% say they would increase their travel by public transport while we find no change in actual behavior in the experiment suggests that there might be an intention to action gap and that with the right policies behavior change is possible.20\\n\\nFootnote 18: Nordstat Sweden added the two questions to their weekly country-wide survey in March 2021.\\n\\nFootnote 19: Given the partial lock down in winter 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it is possible that the perceptions have been downward biased compared to 2018. The results should thus be interpreted as directional.\\n\\nFootnote 20: A further suggestions, made by a referee, is that our intervention changed people’s perception of others’ behavior, but did not change their perceptions of the norm. Thus, it did not trigger a change in behavior.\\n\\nTo estimate the environmental effect of the change in transport behavior, we would need to know which means of transport was substituted. Our data does not allow for this analysis, but results from a representative survey conducted in the year of the experiment by the region of Skane (Hedlund, 2018) show that on average 20% of travel is conducted by public transport, 53% is conducted by car, 16% by bicycle and 10% on foot. In addition, a commuting survey from Sweden (Trafa, 2011) found that in the Malmo area, the largest city in Skane, 58% of people living outside of Malmo, but working in Malmo, commute by car, while 40% commute by bus or train and only 2% commute by bike or walking. Given that we find trip data that is in line with a commuting pattern, it seems most likely that the extra users come from drivers. Other studies which have analyzed the effect of free bus cards on smaller samples provide further evidence that free bus cards have encouraged a transition from car to public transport rather than from bike to public transport (Cooper, 2007; Taniguchi and Fujii, 2007; Thegersen, 2009).\\n\\n## 5 Conclusion\\n\\nUsing behavioral interventions such as social norm nudges have been suggested as a viable way to change individual travel behavior. We show in a field experiment with a public transport operator that a descriptive social norms nudge has no impact on travel behavior in our setting. An economic incentive that doubles the free travel period, however, does affect travel habits for a sub-set of individuals, even long after the incentive has been removed. Our findings are thus in line with the limited literature comparing economic incentives against nudges such as Ito (2015) who find that economic incentives have a longer-term effect on reducing energy consumption than a moral appeal. Our findings are in contrast to a large literature on social norms in the environmental domain, which suggests the need to test nudges in the different domains. Social proof is clearly not the easy and cheap silver bullet, as often suggested in policy reports. Policy makers who do not have the capacities for extensive testing and personalized interventions might be better off implementing an economic incentive to change behavior.\\n\\nAlmost every second recipient orders the free travel card, but there is a steep decline in usage after the free period is over. From a policy perspective, the steep decline could be interpreted as evidence that public transport is experienced as too expensive for many individuals, compared to their preferred mode of transport. Providing free public transport or employers providing free travel cards to their employees, at least for a period of time, might be a promising option, given that close to every second person in our representative sample of the Swedish population is at least willing to try public transport when it is available for free. The good news for the environment is, changing travel habits is possible, but a simple nudge isn\\'t enough.\\n\\n## Declaration of Competing Interest\\n\\nNone.\\n\\n## Appendix A Appendix A\\n\\n### _Probit estimation of main results_\\n\\nThe results from the non-parametric tests are confirmed in five probit regressions in Table A1. Since we have no control variables21, we only regress our three binary outcome variables on the treatments. The standard two-week group is used\\n\\nFigure A1: Online Survey: How often did you travel with the card during the trial period? (\\\\(N=257\\\\)).\\n\\nFigure A2: Online Survey: Will you travel more with Skänetrafiken after the trial period than before? (\\\\(N=221\\\\)).\\n\\nFigure A3: Representative Online Survey: How many people do you think occasionally take public transport in Skäne? (\\\\(N=237\\\\)).\\n\\nas the baseline. For all regressions, we calculate robust standard errors. Column 1 shows the effects of the treatments on the initial response to the card. In the four-week treatment, the cards were 6.8 percentage points more likely to be claimed than in the two-week baseline. This effect is significant at the 1 percent level. The estimate for the social norms treatment is close to zero and not significant. Next we look at activation rates. Column 2 shows the activation rate of the cards. Cards in the four-week treatment were 9.7 percentage points more likely to be claimed than in the baseline group. This effect is significant. The estimate for the social norms treatment is a clear zero. We do the same analysis based on activation after summer. Also for this outcome measure, we find a significant effect of the four-week treatment (Columns 3). The four-week treatment significantly increases the likelihood of a card being used after summer by 1.9 percentage points compared to the baseline. Unsurprisingly, there is no significant effect on the social norms message.\\n\\n## Supplementary material\\n\\nSupplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi:10.1016/j.jebo.2021.07.012.\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \\\\hline \\\\hline  & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{Firsst 2 weeks} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{Experiment} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{Total} & \\\\multicolumn{1}{c}{Total excl.
