Explanation,ID of paper,ID of experiment,ID of condition,"Give each condition a one or two word name to describe it.

Author's words: Where possible, use the label the research authors give it. Look at tables/figures to see their naming conventions for the conditions and use those if they exist.

**Make sure the FIRST (1) condition is considered the CONTROL. This should be the condition you indicate is the focal comparator, in the results tab.","Describe each condition in greater detail. 

Author's words: If the authors have a clear description of each condition in the paper itself, you can copy it here instead of paraphrasing. If their description is not clear enough on its own, or is very verbose, please paraphrase here.

DO NOT mention specific ""nudge"" or ""choice architecture"" concepts here. If the authors do, and you are quoting them, paraphrase over those using brackets [xx]. Specific vocabulary words naming techniques or concepts should appear under ""condition_nudge"".","What nudge concept did the authors mean to use in each condition if any? 

Make sure you are as true as possible to the vocabulary words that the authors use to describe the intervention as a nudge or choice architecture concept in action.

Separate all concepts with a semicolon.

Authors words: If the authors of the paper provide clear language on this, you can copy it here.","Is the condition considered a control or treatment in the original source? 

If there is no control, just call all of them treatment. 

If a control, specify: 
do-nothing control (e.g. no email sent)
plain vanilla control (e.g., the researcher took the treatment email and stripped out all interventions from it, making it a plain control email; it is created for the research and intended to be bland)
business as usual control (e.g., the email the organization was historically sending)
business as usual do-nothing control (e.g., the organization historically did nothing)
","Does the condition contain a major messaging component?

""Y"" indicates that a big part of the condition is about changing language and / or visuals, rather than exclusively about structuring a process, digital, or physical environment or changing incentives.

If it is a do-nothing intervention, select do-nothing.","How many times does the condition create a new touchpoint with the participant at different points in time, independent of any action by the participant, before the outcome is measured? I.e., an initial touchpoint + 1 or more follow-ups, all leading to generating the measured result. 

For example, an initial email is sent and then one week later another is sent = 2 touchpoints.

This will just be ""1"" for many experiments. If a do-nothing condition, the touchpoints will be ""0"".","What is the maximum number of times the condition creates a new touchpoint at different points in time with the participant, including for reasons dependent on actions by the participant, before the outcome is measured? I.e., an initial touchpoint + 1 or more reminders because a participant hasn't responded, all leading to generating the measured result. 

For example, only if a participant doesn't respond to the first email, then a second email is sent = max 2 touchpoints. (The core touchpoints here is 1.)

If a do-nothing condition, the touchpoints will be ""0"".","Does the condition involve financial incentives?

These need not be behaviorally informed. Note this is not about the context being financial, but the condition involving financial incentives.

Note: If all participants are paid for participating in the study, regardless of condition, this does NOT count as the condition being financial. It should be something particular to the given condition.","Does the condition involve providing education or training (behaviorally informed or not)? 

Note: A ""Y"" here goes far beyond just providing information. It should be a more intensive educational offering.","Does the condition forbid any options or restrict the choice situation in some way?

Meaning, there are some choices or actions the individual can no longer take if they are in the given condition.","Consider each treatment group relative to the control group. If the row is the control group, select ""control"".

If not, consider the intent of the authors in designing the intervention: Do the authors believe this treatment makes the behavior ""easier"" to do? 

DEFINITION OF MAKE IT EASY:

Harness the power of defaults. We have a strong tendency to go with the default or pre-set option, since it is easy to do so. Making an option the default makes it more likely to be adopted.
Reduce the 'hassle factor' of taking up a service. The effort required to perform an action often puts people off. Reducing the effort required can increase uptake or response rates.
Simplify messages. Making the message clear often results in a significant increase in response rates to communications. In particular, itâ€™s useful to identify how a complex goal can be broken down into simpler, easier actions.

See here for more","Consider each treatment group relative to the control group. If the row is the control group, select ""control"".

If not, consider the intent of the authors in designing the intervention: Do the authors believe this treatment makes the behavior ""more attractive"" to do? 

DEFINITION OF MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE:

Attract attention. We are more likely to do something that our attention is drawn towards. Ways of doing this include the use of images, colour or personalisation. 
Design rewards and sanctions for maximum effect. Financial incentives are often highly effective, but alternative incentive designs - such as lotteries - also work well and often cost less.

See here for more","Consider each treatment group relative to the control group. If the row is the control group, select ""control"".

If not, consider the intent of the authors in designing the intervention: Do the authors believe this treatment makes the behavior ""more social"" to do? 

DEFINITION OF MAKE IT SOCIAL:

Show that most people perform the desired behaviour. Describing what  most people do in a particular situation encourages others to do the  same. Similarly, policy makers should be wary of inadvertently reinforcing  a problematic behaviour by emphasising its high prevalence.
Use the power of networks. We are embedded in a network of social relationships, and those we come into contact with shape our actions. Governments can foster networks to enable collective action, provide  mutual support, and encourage behaviours to spread peer-to-peer.
Encourage people to make a commitment to others. We often use commitment devices to voluntarily 'lock ourselvesl into doing something in advance. The social nature of these commitments is often crucial.

See here for more","Consider each treatment group relative to the control group. If the row is the control group, select ""control"".

If not, consider the intent of the authors in designing the intervention: Do the authors believe this treatment makes the behavior ""more timely"" to do? 

DEFINITION OF MAKE IT TIMELY:

Prompt people when they are likely to be most receptive. The same offer made at different times can have drastically different levels of success. Behaviour is generally easier to change when habits are already disrupted, such as around major life events.
Consider the immediate costs and benefits. We are more influenced by costs and benefits that take effect immediately than those delivered later. Policy makers should consider whether the immediate costs or benefits can be adjusted (even slightly), given that they are so influential.
Help people plan their response to events. There is a substantial gap between intentions and actual behaviour. A proven solution is to prompt people to identify the barriers to action, and develop a specific plan to address them.

Is it snailmail, i.e., postal mail? This could be a letter, postcard, or other physical mail.","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it electronic mail, i.e., email?","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it on physical paper delivered in person? This might be the case with an in-classroom pen-and-paper experiment, or handing a physical flyer to people in person door to door.","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it in person? This might be a discussion live at a retail store, or the physical redesign of the retail store. Both are delivered live, in person, as an experience.","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it a mobile app? This might include notifications, the layout of the app, etc.","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it online? This might be a website or intranet site.","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it sms, i.e., text message?","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it a phone call or voicemail?","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it nothing? I.e., a do-nothing control?","What is the channel or delivery mechanism of the condition? (It may be the same across conditions, or different.) 

Is it none of the categories to left? If so, please describe it.","Please create a file (png, jpg, pdf) of the intervention in each condition. Focus on the part that a participant experienced -- ideally, this is a screenshot of the email, or the website, or whatever they saw. 

If one of the conditions is a combination of prior conditions, create a file that joins those images or pdfs together into a single file, to represent that condition.

If there is no image or visual stimulus, write NA. If there is just verbatim language, such as from a text message, but not an image of it, see the column called condition_text.

Please name the file using the following: 
type (A or P)_ paper index_experiment index_condition_index_material

For example
Meaning if it is an academic paper (A), paper_index 15, experiment_index 12, condition_index 3, and it is an email, you would write: 
A_15_12_3_email","Save the file of the intervention in our google drive folder. Then click ""share using google drive"", copy the URL that points to that file, and paste it below.

Make sure this is the link to the actual image, not just to the folder.","If the intervention is primarily comprised of wording (subject line, text message) without important formatting or graphics, paste it verbatim here. 

If not, just write NA. 

If it is complicated, explain here.

Note: If you are not filling out this column and not filling out the image column, then note in the last column of this worksheet that we need to get these stimuli from the authors. ","Please take a minute to consider the set of conditions. Are there any potential features of the conditions that are NOT captured in our coding and that might impact outcomes? 

Technically, these would be ""artifacts"" as they might drive outcomes but aren't accounted for in the authors' or our coding. 

Please note them here as they are potential threats to internal validity.","How many units (typically individuals, but it could be clusters) were randomized into each condition?

Note: On the results tab, we capture this by behavioral variable. Sometimes it will be the same as written here. Other times, due to incomplete data collection for some behavioral outcomes, it is a smaller number than you'll write below. This column on the condition tab should be the largest number. ","Use this space to write out anything important about the condition that you think is not well captured already by other columns, and that is important for understanding its deployment and /or efficacy in the experiment."
